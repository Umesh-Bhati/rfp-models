Examples ofsuch exemptions are: personnel records, and priviliged or confidential documents that would infringe on the individual right to privacy. The District will not disclose records submitted by a proposer that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, subject to the following procedures and limitations.\n\nThe Proposer shall mark all proposal pages containing the records it has determined as confidential under California Public Records Law and shall segregate those pages in the following manner:\n\n- Such pages will be clearly marked \"Confidential\" on each page of the confidential document.\n- Proposer will separate confidential pages from its other Proposal pages by providing the confidential pages to the District in a separate envelope or package.\n- In its proposal, Proposer will cite the specific statutory exemption from the CPRA exempting such pages from disclosure.\n- This section will prevail in the event these provisions conflict with formatting or response instructions elsewhere in this document.\n\nProposers may not mark an entire Proposal confidential. Should a proposal be submitted in this manner, the District will hold no portion of the proposal as confidential, unless such a portion is segregated per the bullets above and is determined exempt from the CPRA.\n\nNotwithstanding the above procedures, the District reserves the right to disclose information that the District determines, in its sole discretion, is not exempt from disclosure or that the District is directed to disclose by a court or entity of competent jurisdiction.\n\nPrior to disclosing such information, the District will make reasonable attempts to notify the Proposer of the pending disclosure.\n\n## 6 **Protest** of **Solicitation** or **Award**\n\n## **Protest** of **Solicitation** or **Contract Documents**\n\nAny prospective Proposer wishing to protest this RFP or any provision, specification or contract term herein, must submit such a protest to the Contact on page 1 of this RFP.\n\nThe deadline for submitting such protests is the same date as the deadline for questions listed on the first page of this RFP.\n\n#### **6.1.1 Content** of **Solicitation Protest**\n\nThe prospective Proposer's written solicitation protest must include all of the following:\n\n- Sufficient information to identify the solicitation that is the subject of the protest;\n- The grounds that demonstrate how the procurement process is contrary to law or how the solicitation document is unnecessarily restrictive, is legally flawed, or improperly specifies a Brand Name;\n- Evidence or supporting documentation that supports the grounds on which the protest is based; and\n- A statement of the desired changes to the Procurement process or the solicitation document that the prospective Proposer believes will remedy the conditions upon which the prospective Proposer based its protest.\n\n### **Protest** of **Contract Award**\n\nAdversely affected Proposers who wish to protest the Competitive Range, proposal rejection as non\u2010 responsive, the Intent to Award a contract, may do so providing:\n\n- The Proposer is adversely affected because the Proposer would be eligible to be awarded the contract in the event that the protest were successful: and\n- The reason for the protest is that all higher\u2010ranked proposals are non\u2010responsive;\n- The District has failed to conduct the evaluation of Proposals in accordance with the criteria or processes described in the solicitation materials;\n- The District has abused its discretion in rejecting the protestor's Proposal as non\u2010responsive or;\n- The District's evaluation of Proposals or the District's subsequent determination of Award is otherwise in violation of its Public Contracting Code.\n\nAn affected Proposer may only protest its exclusion from a tier of competition if the Proposer is responsible, submitted a responsive proposal and, but for the District's mistake in evaluating the Proposer's offer, or other Proposer Offers, the protesting Proposer would have been eligible to participate in the next tier of competition.\n\nAll protests must be submitted in writing via email to: the Finance Manager at debbiem@carmichaelwd.org no later than 2:00 PM Pacific Time on the seventh (7th) calendar day after the posted Notice of Intent to Award or rejection. Include a subject line of \"RFP Protest\".\n\nProtests must specify the grounds for the protest including the specific citation of law, rule, regulation, or procedure upon which the protest is based. The judgment used in scoring by individual evaluators is not grounds for protest.\n\nProtests not filed within the time specified time herein, or which fail to cite the specific law, rule, regulation, or procedure upon which the protest is based shall be dismissed. An issue that could have been raised by request for clarification or protest of solicitation or contract documents is not grounds for protest.\n\n## 7 **Contract Terms** and **Conditions**\n\n#### **District contract**\n\nProposers are advised to thoroughly review and familiarize themselves with the District sample professional services contract incorporated as Attachment A. The successful proposer will be invited to enter into a contract in substantially the form attached hereto as Attachment A. Any contract resulting from this RFP shall be based on the RFP documents and in compliance with the District's Public Contracting Rules and the Public Contracting Code.\n\n## **Insurance**\n\nProposers are advised to carefully review the insurance requirements contained in the sample standard contract.\n\n#### **Attachment A**\n\n## **Carmichael Water District Services Agreement**\n\nThis Agreement is entered into as of the date last signed and dated below by and between Carmichael Water District, a local government agency (\"District\"), and\n\n, a [*Insert type and jurisdiction of* \n\n*entity*] (\"Contractor\"), who agree as follows:\n\n## 1 **Scope of Work**\n\nContractor shall perform the work and render the services described in the attached Exhibit A (the \"Work\"). Contractor shall provide all labor, services, equipment, tools, material and supplies required or necessary to properly, competently and completely perform the Work. Contractor shall determine the method, details and means of doing the Work.\n\n## 2 **Payment**\n\n- 2.1 District shall pay to Contractor a fee based on *[check one]*:\n\t- ___ Contractor's time and expenses necessarily and actually expended or incurred on the Work in accordance with Contractor's fee schedule on the attached Exhibit A.\n\n_X__ The fee arrangement described on the attached RFP.\n\nThe total fee for the Work shall not exceed $____________. There shall be no compensation for extra or additional work or services by Contractor unless approved in advance in writing by District. Contractor's fee includes all of Contractor's costs and expenses related to the Work.\n\n2.2 At the end of each month, Contractor shall submit to District an invoice for the Work performed during the preceding month. The invoice shall include a brief description of the Work performed, the dates of Work, number of hours worked and by whom (if payment is based on time), payment due, and an itemization of any reimbursable expenditures. If the Work is satisfactorily completed and the invoice is accurately computed, District shall pay the invoice within 30 days of its receipt.\n\n## 3 **Term**\n\n3.1 This Agreement shall take effect on the above date and continue in effect until completion of the Work, unless sooner terminated as provided below. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If Exhibit A includes a Work schedule or deadline, then Contractor must complete the Work in accordance with the specified schedule or deadline, which may be extended by District for good cause shown by Contractor. If Exhibit A does not include a Work schedule or deadline, then Contractor must perform the Work diligently and as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the professional skill and care appropriate for the orderly progress of the Work.\n\n3.2 This Agreement may be terminated at any time by District upon 10 days advance written notice to Contractor. In the event of such termination, Contractor shall be fairly compensated for all work performed to the date of termination as calculated by District based on the above fee and payment provisions. Compensation under this section shall not include any termination-related expenses, cancellation or demobilization charges, or lost profit associated with the expected completion of the Work or other such similar payments relating to Contractor's claimed benefit of the bargain.\n\n## 4 **Professional Ability of Contractor**\n\n4.1 Contractor represents that it is specially trained and experienced, and possesses the skill, ability, knowledge and certification, to competently perform the Work provided by this Agreement. District has relied upon Contractor's training, experience, skill, ability, knowledge and certification as a material inducement to enter into this Agreement. All Work performed by Contractor shall be in accordance with applicable legal requirements and meet the standard of care and quality ordinarily to be expected of competent professionals in Contractor's field.\n\n4.2 The following individuals are designated as key personnel and are considered to be essential to the successful performance of the work hereunder: [*Describe Contractor's key personnel by name or by reference, e.g. the individuals whose resumes are included in Exhibit A.*]. Contractor agrees that these individuals may not be removed from the Work or replaced without compliance with the following sections:\n\n4.2.1 If one or more of the key personnel, for whatever reason, becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this contract for a continuous period exceeding 30 work days, or is expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in the proposal or initially anticipated, Contractor shall immediately notify District and shall, subject to District's concurrence, promptly replace the personnel with personnel of at least substantially equal ability and qualifications.\n\n4.2.2 Each request for approval of substitutions must be in writing and contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions. The request must also contain a complete resume for the proposed substitute and other information requested or needed by District to evaluate the proposed substitution. District shall evaluate Contractor's request and District shall promptly notify Contractor of its decision in writing.\n\n## 5 **Conflict of Interest**\n\nContractor (including principals, associates and professional employees) represents and acknowledges that (a) it does not now have and shall not acquire any direct or indirect investment, interest in real property or source of income that would be affected in any manner or degree by the performance of Contractor's services under this agreement, and (b) no person having any such interest shall perform any portion of the Work. The parties agree that Contractor is not a designated employee within the meaning of the Political Reform Act and District's conflict of interest code because Contractor will perform the Work independent of the control and direction of the District or of any District official, other than normal contract monitoring, and Contractor possesses no authority with respect to any District decision beyond the rendition of information, advice, recommendation or counsel.\n\n## 6 **Contractor Records**\n\n6.1 Contractor shall keep and maintain all ledgers, books of account, invoices, vouchers, canceled checks, and other records and documents evidencing or relating to the Work and invoice preparation and support for a minimum period of three years (or for any longer period required by law) from the date of final payment to Contractor under this Agreement. District may inspect and audit such books and records, including source documents, to verify all charges, payments and reimbursable costs under this Agreement.\n\n6.2 In accordance with California Government Code section 8546.7, the parties acknowledge that this Agreement, and performance and payments under it, are subject to examination and audit by the California State Auditor for three years following final payment under the Agreement.\n\n## 7 **Ownership of Documents**\n\nAll works of authorship and every report, study, spreadsheet, worksheet, plan, design, blueprint, specification, drawing, map, photograph, computer model, computer disk, magnetic tape, CAD data file, computer software and any other document or thing prepared, developed or created by Contractor under this Agreement and provided to District (\"Work Product\") shall be the property of District, and District shall have the rights to use, modify, reuse, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute the Work Product and to prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on the Work Product without further compensation to Contractor or any other party. Contractor may retain a copy of any Work Product and use, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute any Work Product and prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on any Work Product; provided, however, that Contractor shall not provide any Work Product to any third party without District's prior written approval, unless compelled to do so by legal process. If any Work Product is copyrightable, Contractor may copyright the same, except that, as to any Work Product that is copyrighted by Contractor, District reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to use, reuse, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute the Work Product and to prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on the Work Product. If District reuses or modifies any Work Product for a use or purpose other than that intended by the scope of work under this Agreement, then District shall hold Contractor harmless against all claims, damages, losses and expenses arising from such reuse or modification. For any Work Product provided to District in paper format, upon request by District at any time (including, but not limited to, at expiration or termination of this Agreement), Contractor agrees to provide the Work Product to District in a readable, transferable and usable electronic format generally acknowledged as being an industrystandard format for information exchange between computers (e.g., Word file, Excel spreadsheet file, AutoCAD file).\n\n## 8 **Confidentiality of Information** \u2013 **Intentionally Omitted**\n\n### 9 **Compliance with Laws**\n\n9.1 General.

(See California Labor Code section 1720(a).) If the Work includes some labor as described in the preceding sentence and other labor that is not, then this section 9.2 applies only to workers performing the preconstruction and post-construction work.\n\n9.2.1.2 \"Maintenance\" work, which means (i) routine, recurring and usual work for the preservation, protection and keeping of any District facility, plant, building, structure, utility system or other property (\"District Facility\") in a safe and continually usable condition, (ii) carpentry, electrical, plumbing, glazing, touchup painting, and other craft work designed to preserve any District Facility in a safe, efficient and continuously usable condition, including repairs, cleaning and other operations on District machinery and equipment, and (iii) landscape maintenance. \"Maintenance\" excludes (i) janitorial or custodial services of a routine, recurring or usual nature, and (ii) security, guard or other protection-related services. (See California Labor Code section 1771 and 8 California Code of Regulations section 16000.) If the Work includes some \"maintenance\" work and other work that is not \"maintenance,\" then this section 9.2 applies only to workers performing the \"maintenance\" work.\n\n9.2.2 Contractor shall comply with the California Labor Code provisions concerning payment of prevailing wage rates, penalties, employment of apprentices, hours of work and overtime, keeping and retention of payroll records, and other requirements applicable to public works as may be required by the Labor Code and applicable state regulations.

The duty to indemnify, including the duty and the cost to defend, is limited as provided in this section. However, this indemnity provision will not apply to any Claim arising from the sole negligence or willful misconduct of District or its employees or agents. Contractor's obligations under this indemnification provision shall survive the termination of, or completion of Work under, this Agreement.\n\n10.2 This section 10.2 applies if the Contractor is a \"design professional\" as that term is defined in Civil Code section 2782.8. If a court or arbitrator determines that the incident or occurrence that gave rise to the Claim was partially caused by the fault of an Indemnitee, then in no event shall Contractor's total costs incurred pursuant to its duty to defend Indemnitees exceed Contractor's proportionate percentage of fault as determined by a final judgment of a court or final decision of arbitrator.\n\n## 11 **Insurance**\n\nTypes & Limits. Contractor at its sole cost and expense shall procure and maintain for the duration of this Agreement the following types and limits of insurance:\n\n| Type | Limits | Scope |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Commercial general liability | $2,000,000 per occurrence & | at least as broad as |\n|  | $4,000,000 aggregate | Insurance Services Office |\n|  |  | (ISO) Commercial General |\n|  |  | Liability Coverage |\n|  |  | (Occurrence Form CG 00 01) |\n\n|  |  | including products and completed operations, |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | property damage, bodily |\n|  |  | injury, personal and |\n|  |  | advertising injury |\n| Automobile liability | $1,000,000 per accident | at least as broad as ISO |\n|  |  | Business Auto Coverage |\n|  |  | (Form CA 00 01) |\n| Workers' compensation | Statutory limits |  |\n| Employers' liability | $1,000,000 per accident |  |\n| Professional liability* | $1,000,000 per claim |  |\n\n*Required only if Contractor is a licensed engineer, land surveyor, geologist, architect, doctor, attorney or accountant.\n\n11.1 Other Requirements.

Contractor's general and automobile coverage shall be primary and apply separately to each insurer against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer's liability. District's insurance or self-insurance, if any, shall be excess and shall not contribute with Contractor's insurance. Each insurance policy shall be endorsed to state that coverage shall not be canceled, except after 30 days (10 days for non-payment of premium) prior written notice to District. Insurance is to be placed with insurers authorized to do business in California with a current A.M. Best's rating of A:VII or better unless otherwise acceptable to District. Workers' compensation insurance issued by the State Compensation Insurance Fund is acceptable.

This Agreement supersedes all prior oral or written negotiations, representations, contracts or other documents that may be related to the Work, except those other documents (if any) that are expressly referenced in this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended only by a subsequent written contract approved and signed by both parties.\n\n12.2 **Independent Contractor.** Contractor's relationship to District is that of an independent contractor. All persons hired by Contractor and performing the Work shall be Contractor's employees or agents. Contractor and its officers, employees and agents are not District employees, and they are not entitled to District employment salary, wages or benefits.

Contractor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify District, and its officers, employees, volunteers and agents from and against any and all liability, penalties, expenses and costs resulting from any adverse determination by the federal Internal Revenue Service, California Franchise Tax Board, other federal or state agency, or court concerning Contractor's independent contractor status or employment-related liability.\n\n12.3 **Subcontractors.** No subcontract shall be awarded nor any subcontractor engaged by Contractor without District's prior written approval.

Any transfer, assignment, delegation, or subcontract in violation of this provision is null and void and grounds for the other party to terminate the Agreement.\n\n12.5 **No Waiver of Rights.** Any waiver at any time by either party of its rights as to a breach or default of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver as to any other breach or default. No payment by District to Contractor shall be considered or construed to be an approval or acceptance of any Work or a waiver of any breach or default.\n\n12.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then the remaining parts will continue in full force and effect and be fully binding, provided that each party still receives the benefits of this Agreement.\n\n12.7 **Governing Law and Venue.** This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

We understand that you require us to conduct an audit of the financial statement of the CWD, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, with an option to extend for four (4) additional years, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted (GAAS) in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in *Government Auditing Standards*, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the provisions of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Uniform Guidance, Audits of State and Local Governments, and the requirements of the Minimum Standards for Audits for State of California governmental agencies; and in compliance with any and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n**Annual Financial Audit:** We will conduct the District's annual financial audit in accordance with GAAS, GAS, and the Minimum Audit Requirements and Reporting Guidelines for California Special Districts. Upon completion of the annual audit, we will issue an opinion on the District's financial statements and will submit all audit standard required reports, including but not limited to: the Independent Auditor's Report, SAS 114 letter, Auditor's Communication with Those Charged With Governance SAS 115, Communicating Internal Control Related Matters (if applicable) and any audit comments and disclosures required by State regulation.\n\n**Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR):** We will prepare, edit, and produce all sections of the ACFR each year based on financial and other information provided by the District. We will ensure that the District's ACFR conforms to the provisions and mandatory criteria of the program (GFOA) and will prepare annually the District's responses to comments and suggestions made by the award program reviewer on the preceding year's report as submitted to the program.\n\n**Federal Single Audit:** We will issue the Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards, Independent Auditor's Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program and Report on Internal Control over Compliance Required by the Uniform Guidance, and Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs.\n\n**Agreed - Upon Procedures:** We will perform (upon request of the Board of Directors) agreed-upon procedures, as set forth in Exhibit D, to review the application of the District's pay and benefits to employees and evaluate the adherence to District Policy, and Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, including the Public Employment Retirement Law (PERL) used by CalPERS to administer retirement benefits.\n\n**Financial Transactions Report:** We will prepare and timely file the California State Controller's Office (SCO) Special District Financial Transactions Report (FTR).\n\n- We will provide assistance to the District's Finance Department in understanding and implementing Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards impacting the District.\n![](_page_20_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- We will provide technical assistance regarding its applications to receive certifications or awards for its financial reporting, such as the Government Finance Officer Association (GFOA) Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting.\nIn case of extraordinary circumstances requiring intensive examination, we will provide written documentation detailing the situation, an estimate of additional hours needed, and a proposal for the scope and cost of the work. We will don't proceed without written direction from the District.\n\n### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the CWD's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the CWD Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the CWD's financial systems and processes.\n\nThis will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the CWD Officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the CWD may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the CWD Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the CWD and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to Carmichael Water District to aid the CWD's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n## **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the CWD's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n## **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Receipts\n- Payroll\n- Financial reporting\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state programs\n- IT and general computer controls\n\nBased on our understanding of the CWD's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the CWD's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n## **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n## **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n### **Rules and Regulations**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP will meet all specific requirements imposed by state or local law or rules and regulations. We will review the laws and regulations covering the CWD's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the CWD staff and review of any CWD's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the CWD of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the CWD and successor auditors, and allow the CWD and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance. We will make audit work papers available upon your request to the following parties or their designee:\n\n- Carmichael Water District;\n- Auditors of entities of which the Carmichael Water District is a sub-recipient of grant funds.\n\n### **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink* gives us the capability of sending and receiving information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the CWD's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program; CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we are able to develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of Carmichael Water District. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the CWD's employees who are granted access.\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the CWD which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n## **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the CWD as the work proceeds and once on complete of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities.\n\nBy reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the CWD's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the City and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.\n\n### Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the City's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date. including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.\n\nIn performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:\n\n- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. .\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or . error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\n- . Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting \u25cf estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise \u25cf substantial doubt about the City's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\n\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.\n\n### Required Supplementary Information\n\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the required supplementary information and budgetary comparison information as listed in the table of contents be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.\n\nManagement has omitted the Management's Discussion and Analysis that accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require to be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such missing information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic or historical context. Our opinion on the basic financial statements is not affected by this missing information.\n\n![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nOur audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the City's basic financial statements. The introductory section and combining nonmajor fund financial statements are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.\n\nThe combining nonmajor fund financial statements are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the combining nonmajor fund financial statements are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.\n\nThe introductory section has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.\n\n### Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards\n\nIn accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated MMMM DD, YYYY, on our consideration of the City's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the City's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the City's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.\n\nOakland, California\n\n![](_page_32_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_33_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nCERTIFIED PIIRLIC ACCOIIN\n\n### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS\n\nTo the Board of Supervisors and the Grand Jury Client Name City, State\n\nWe have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Client Name, California (the \"City\"), as of and for the year ended June 30, 20XX, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City's basic financial statements and have issued our report thereon dated MMMM DD, YYYY.\n\n### Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the City's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the City's internal control.\n\nA deficiency in internal controlexists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.\n\nOur consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit, we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that we have not been identified.\n\n![](_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### Report on Compliance and Other Matters\n\nAs part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the City's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.\n\n### Purpose of This Report\n\nThe purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the City's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the City's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.\n\nOakland, California MMMM DD, 20XX\n\n![](_page_34_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_35_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nCERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNT.\n\n### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE\n\nTo the Board of Supervisors and the Grand Jurv Client Name City, State\n\n### Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program\n\n### Opinion on Each Major Federal Program\n\nWe have audited the Client Name, California's (the \"City\") compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the City's major federal programs for the vear ended June 30, 20XX. The City's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.\n\nIn our opinion, the City complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 20XX.\n\n### Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program\n\nWe conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.\n\nWe are required to be independent of the City and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the City's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.\n\n### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance\n\nManagement is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the City's federal programs.\n\n![](_page_36_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the City's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the City's compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole.\n\nIn performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance, we:\n\n- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. .\n- . Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the City's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n- . Obtain an understanding of the City's internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City's internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.\n\n### Other Matters\n\nThe results of our auditing procedures disclosed an instance of noncompliance which is required to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which is described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as Finding 2022-001. Our opinion on each major federal program is not modified with respect to this matter. Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform limited procedures on the City's response to the noncompliance finding identified in our audit described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. The City's response was not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.\n\n### Report on Internal Control Over Compliance\n\nOur consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. However, as discussed below, we did identify certain deficiency in internal control over compliance that we consider to be significant deficiency.\n\n![](_page_36_Picture_13.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_37_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nA deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.\n\nA significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the deficiency in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as item 2022-001 to be significant deficiency.\n\nOur audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform limited procedures on the City's response to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our audit described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.\n\nThe City's response was not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.\n\nThe purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.\n\nOakland, California MMMM DD, 20XX\n\n![](_page_37_Picture_8.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_38_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **PROPOSED PRICE (Attachment C)**\n\nOur fees are generally lower than other competing firms since we keep our overhead low; we follow a scientific audit approach and we make extensive use of emerging technologies that allow us to conduct audits efficiently.

Typically, a review will include the following:\n\n- Seniors will review all work performed by staff.\n- Managers will review work performed by seniors as well as review key significant areas that was prepared by staff and reviewed by the senior.

The success of the audit is dependent on the amount of open communication throughout the year and not just during the audit period.

We believe in no surprises. When we perform the exit conference, we will hold a final discussion on any potential findings and will come to a conclusion during the conference. Our goal is to have no additional findings subsequent to the exit conference.\n\n![](_page_16_Picture_12.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_17_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **WORK PLAN**\n\n## **Scope of Work**\n\nAt Harshwal & Company, LLP, our professionals have extensive experience performing audits of state and local governments and our team has a broad understanding of the work environment that is necessary to conduct both financial and compliance audit of the financial statements of the City. We understand that you require us to perform an audit/examine of the financial statements/combined financial statements of the City for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2023, through June 30, 2025, with an option to extend for two (2) subsequent fiscal years, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the standards set forth for financial audits in the U.S. Government Accountability Office's (GAO) Government Auditing Standards (GAS), the provisions of the Federal Single Audit Act and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 Audits of States, Local Governments, and non-profit organizations. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n## **1. Annual Financial Reports**\n\nWe will prepare the City's financial statements and fully comply with all applicable GASB statements. We will perform an audit of all funds of the City in accordance with all applicable auditing standards. We will prepare and word-process the Annual Financial Reports, including Government-wide Financial Statements, Fund Financial Statements, note disclosures, required supplementary information (RSI), and combining financial statements. We will provide our report on the basic financial statements, which will include both Government-wide Financial Statements and Fund Financial Statements. We will also apply limited audit procedures to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and required supplementary information (RSI) pertaining to the General Fund and each major fund of the City, which will be prepared by the City staff.\n\n## **2. Single Audit**\n\nIf required We will perform a single audit on the expenditures of federal grants in accordance with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Grant Guidance/Super Circular and render the appropriate audit reports on Internal Control over Financial Reporting based upon the audit of the City's financial statements in accordance with government auditing standards and the appropriate reports on compliance with Requirements Applicable to each Major Program, Internal Control over Compliance, and on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. The single audit report will include the appropriate schedule of expenditures of federal awards, footnotes, findings, and questioned costs, including reportable conditions and material weaknesses, and follow-up on prior audit findings where required.\n\n#### **3. Measure X Annual Compliance Audit**\n\nThe City of Greenfield's Measure X or Transportation Safety and Investment Plan Account Fund is reported in the City's Annual Financial Reports as a Special Revenue Fund. We will prepare a separate Annual Financial Report for the Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC).\n\n#### **4. Appropriations Limit**\n\nWe will perform agreed-upon procedures pertaining to the City's Article XIIIB Limit (Appropriations Limit) and render a letter annually to the City regarding compliance.\n\n![](_page_17_Picture_13.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **5. Preparation and submission of Annual Streets Report (ASR)**\n\nWe will prepare and submit the ASR to the State Controller's Office (SCO) on or before December 1 of each year. This is pursuant to section 2151 of the California Streets and Highways Code (with the exception of FY 22-23).\n\n#### **6. Preparation and submission of City Financial Transactions Report (FTR)**\n\nWe will prepare and submit the City FTR to the State Controller's Office (SCO) on or before January 31 of each year (with the exception of FY 22-23).\n\n#### **7. Management Report**\n\nWe will issue a separate management letter that includes recommendations for improvements in internal control, accounting procedures, and other significant observations that are considered non-reportable conditions. Management letters will be addressed to the City Manager.\n\n#### **8. Additional Consultation**\n\nWe will provide consultation throughout the year as an information resource and will guide on implementing federal and state regulations as they may affect local government accounting. This would not include any task that entails significant research or a formal report. We will keep the City informed of new guidance and developments that may affect municipal accounting and finance.\n\n#### **Reports to be Issued:**\n\nWe will issue the following reports upon completion of the Audit of Financial Statements of the City:\n\n- 1. Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR).\n- 2. Accountants' Report on Agreed-Upon Procedures Applied to Appropriations Limit Calculation.\n- 3.

Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the City's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the City Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the City's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the City Officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, the assistance the City may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the City Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n### **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the City and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to City of Greenfield to aid the City's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n![](_page_19_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the City's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Financial reporting\n- IT and general computer controls\n\n- Receipts\n- Journal entry process\n- Payroll\n- Federal and state programs\n\nBased on our understanding of the City's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n## **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n#### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the City's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_26.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering the City's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the City staff and review of any City's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n#### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the City of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the City and successor auditors, and allow the City and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n## **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the City as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement.\n\nThe audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the City's Council. The report will be discussed with the city manager for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Audit Timeline of Major Milestones**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP is prepared to meet the deadlines required.\n\n| Milestones | Completion Dates |\n| --- | --- |\n| Audit of FY 2022-23 | October 1, 2024 - February 28, 2025 |\n| Audit of FY 2023-24 | March 15, 2025 - June 30, 2025 |\n| Interim Audit Fieldwork (FY 2024-25) | May 15 or before each year |\n| Year-End Audit Fieldwork Completed (FY 2024-25) | September 30 or before each year |\n| Draft Audit Report for review (FY 2024-25) | November 15 or before each year |\n| Final Audit Report (FY 2024-25) | December 31 or before each year |\n| Annual Streets Report (with the exception of FY 2022-23) | December 01 or before each year |\n| Measure X Audit Report (with the exception of FY 2022-23) | December 31 or before each year |\n| Financial Transactions Report (with the exception of FY 2022-23) | January 31 or before each year |\n\n- *The timeline is reasonable given the totality of work involved and our managers being highly qualified and trained.

Background Information - City\n\nThe City of Shafter was incorporated January 11, 1938. It is a charter city with a Council-Manager form of government. The City is governed by a fivemember City Council, who serve four-year overlapping terms, and are elected at large by City residents. The Council selects among themselves who will serve as the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tempore for a term of two years. The population of the City is approximately 23,000 residents. The City's fiscal year begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th.\n\nThe City provides municipal services including police, community and economic development, city planning and building regulation, parks and street maintenance, water and sewer utilities, and general City administration. Fire Service is provided by Kern County Fire. Water service is provided by the City and Oildale Mutual Water. Wastewater is treated by the North of River Sanitation District. Recycling and solid waste disposal services are provided in the City by the City, Varner Brothers, and American Refuse.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024-25, the appropriations for the General Fund and all funds combined are $39.08 million and $86.12 million, respectively. More detailed information on the City government and its finances can be found in Annual Budget documents and the Basic Financial Statements, located on the City's website.\n\n## C. Component Units\n\nBlended component units, although legally separate entities, are in substance, part of the City's operations and so data from these units are reported with the inter-fund data of the primary government. The Successor Agency to the former Redevelopment Agency (Successor Agency) is considered to be a blended component unit of the reporting entity of the City.\n\n## D. Fund Structure\n\nThe City uses the following fund types in its financial reporting:\n\n|  | Number of |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Individual |\n|  | Funds |\n| Assets, Debt and Disbursement | 3 |\n| General fund | 1 |\n| Special revenue funds | 25 |\n| Capital projects funds | 10 |\n| Enterprise funds | 6 |\n| Internal service funds | 4 |\n| Trust and agency funds | 1 |\n\nThe City's major funds have included the General Fund, Federal Grants, and the Transportation Fund in governmental activities and the Water, and Wastewater Funds in the business- type activities.\n\nThe total municipal budget for the 2024-2025 fiscal year (including capital improvements) is approximately $86.12 million and by fund name/fund type as follows:\n\n| Fund Name/Type | Budget |\n| --- | --- |\n| General Fund | $39.08M |\n| Special Revenue Funds | 9.13M |\n| Capital Project Funds | 14.26M |\n| Internal Service Funds | 4.13M |\n| Enterprise Funds | 19.52M |\n| Total | $86.12M |\n\n### E. Budgetary Basis of Accounting\n\nBudgets for the General, Special Revenue, Capital Projects and Debt Service Funds are adopted on a basis consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The modified accrual basis of accounting is employed in the preparation of the budget. At fiscal year-end, budget appropriations lapse.\n\nCapital projects are budgeted on a multi-year basis. Unspent capital improvement budget amounts are re-appropriated in the following fiscal year, up to a total of three years before the appropriation expires.\n\n### F. Federal Financial Assistance\n\nThe City receives financial assistance from several federal agencies, which is reported in the City's Schedule of Federal of Awards.\n\n### G. Pension Plans\n\nThe City contributes to the California Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS), an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State of California.\n\n## H. Information Technology\n\nThe City's accounting, financial reporting, and investing functions are centralized in the Finance Department. The City uses financial software by Tyler Technologies, Inc. Currently, we are in the final stages of implementation of Tyler Munis. Investment tracking and reporting is accomplished using Clearwater.\n\n## I. Finance Operations\n\nThe Finance Department is headed by the Finance Director, Roger Sanchez. The principal functions include Department Administration, Accounting (accounting and reporting, accounts payable, payroll, investments, some grants) and Revenue (utility billing and collection, licensing, accounts receivable).\n\n## III.

Review of Qualifications and Proposals\nProposals will be evaluated by the Administrative Services Director and the Accounting Manager. The recommendations will be submitted to the City Council for final approval. The evaluation will use a point formula during the review process to score proposals. Each evaluator will first score each technical proposal by each of the criteria described in Section VII B below. The individual scores will then be combined to arrive at a composite technical score for each firm. At this point, firms with an unacceptably low technical score will be eliminated from further consideration.\n\nAfter the composite technical score for each firm has been established, the cost proposal will be reviewed, and additional points will be added to the technical score based on the price bid. The maximum score for price will be assigned to the firm offering the lowest total all-inclusive maximum price. Appropriate fractional scores will be assigned to other proposers.\n\nThe City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted and use any idea in a proposal regardless of whether that proposal is selected.\n\n## B. Evaluation Criteria\n\nProposals will be evaluated using three sets of criteria.

The firm has no conflict of interest or impairment to independence with regard to any other work performed by the firm for the City and other entities\n\t- c. The firm adheres to the instructions in this request for qualifications and proposal on preparing and submitting the proposal\n\t- d. The firm submits a copy of its last external quality control review report and the firm has a record of quality audit work.\n- 2. Technical Qualifications:\n\t- I. Expertise and Experience\n\t\t- (1) The firm's experience and performance on comparable government engagements\n\t\t- (2) The quality of the firm's professional personnel to be assigned to the engagement and the quality of the firm's management support personnel to be available for technical consultation\n\t- II. Audit Approach\n\t\t- (1) Adequacy of proposed staffing plan for various segments of the engagement\n\t\t- (2) Adequacy of sampling techniques\n\t\t- (3) Adequacy of analytical procedures\n- 3. Price:\n\nCost will not be the primary factor in the selection of an audit firm\n\n## C. Final Selection\n\nThe City Council will select a firm based upon the evaluation and recommendation. It is anticipated that a firm will be selected in the month of September 2024.\n\n### D. Right to Reject Qualifications and Proposals\n\nSubmission of a proposal indicates acceptance by the firm of the conditions contained in this request for qualifications and proposal, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the firm selected.\n\nThe City reserves the right without prejudice to reject any or all qualifications and proposals.\n\n### APPENDICES\n\n- A Maximum Fee and Hourly Rates\n- B.

We understand that you require us to perform an audit of the financial statements of the City for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2025, through June 30, 2027, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, *Government Auditing Standards* issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- **Comprehensive Annual Financial Report -** We will audit the Basic Financial Statements of the City to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. We will express an opinion on the fair presentation of the City's governmental activities, business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. We will also be performing certain limited procedures involving management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) and the required supplementary information (RSI) required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board as mandated by Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.\n- **Single Audit Act Report -** We will perform a single audit on the expenditures of federal grants in accordance with the provisions of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and the provisions of U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations and render the appropriate audit reports on Internal Control over Finance Reporting based upon the audit of the City's financial statements in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and the appropriate reports on compliance with requirements applicable to each major program, and internal control over compliance. Additionally, we will submit the required information to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.\n- **Transportation Development Act Audit and Related Reports -** We will perform a financial and compliance audit of funding under the Transportation Development Act. We will prepare and publish the City's Local Transportation Fund Audit Report, including balance sheets, comparative statement of revenues and expenses, comparative statements of cash flows, and other supplemental information. We will issue a written opinion as a part of the Audit Report as to the 'conformity' of the representation and financial position of the respective financial statements.\n- **Management Letter -** We will issue a separate \"management letter'' that includes recommendations for improvements in internal control, accounting procedures, and other significant observations that are considered to be non-reportable conditions. The management letter shall be addressed to the City Manager. Prior to its release, City staff shall be allowed to review and comment.\n- We will assist on year-end AJE related to GASB 68, 75, 87, 96.\n- **GANN Limit -** We will test compliance with Proposition 111, Article XIII.B, and will review Appropriation Limit Calculations for the City.\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- We will provide an \"in-relation-to\" report on the combining and individual fund financial statements and supporting schedules based on the auditing procedures applied during the audit of the basic financial statements.\n- We will perform certain limited procedures involving required supplementary information required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board as mandated by Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.\n- We will provide an \"in-relation-to\" report on the schedule of expenditures of federal awards based on the auditing procedures applied during the audit of the financial statements.\n\n#### **Reports to be Issued:**\n\nWe will issue the following reports upon completion of the Audit of Financial Statements of the City:\n\n- 1. A report on the fair presentation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP for all entities listed above.\n- 2. A report on compliance and internal control over financial reporting based on an audit of the financial statements.\n- 3. A report on compliance with requirements applicable to each major program and internal control over compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A-133.\n- 4. A report on compliance with specific requirements applicable to non-major federal financial assistance programs.\n- 5. Other reports, as requirements change, will be added as additional work, as covered in this RFP by the terms for such work.\n\n#### **Special Considerations:**\n\n- We will issue the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and related auditors' reports, as well as the reports on the internal controls and compliance these reports will be issued separately from the basic financial statements.\n- We will provide additional services, including the implementation of future GASB statements that may become effective during the term of the contract, subject to compliance with independence standards. (upon request as additional work)\n- We will provide advice to the City on complex accounting and other issues that may be unfamiliar to staff or may be subject to differing interpretations.\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the City's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the City Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the City's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the City Officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, the assistance the City may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the City Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n#### **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n### **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the City and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to City of Shafter to aid the City's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the City's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements Financial reporting\n- Receipts Journal entry process\n- Payroll Federal and state programs\n- IT and general computer controls\n\nBased on our understanding of the City's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n#### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering the City's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the City staff and review of any City's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n#### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the City's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_23.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centred around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n#### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the City of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the City and successor auditors, and allow the City and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance. We will make working papers available upon request to the following parties or their designees:\n\n- City of Shafter\n- Oversight or cognizant agencies\n- Parties designated by the federal or state governments or by the City as part of an audit quality review process\n- Auditors of entities of which the City is a sub-recipient of grant funds.\n- Auditors of entities of which the City is a component unit.\n\n#### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the City as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement.\n\nThe audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. If we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the City's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_30_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- **Irregularities and illegal acts -** We will make an immediate, written report of all irregularities and illegal acts or indications of illegal acts of which we become aware to the following parties:\n\t- Gabriel A. Gonzalez, City Manager\n\t- Marco A. Martinez, City Attorney\n\t- Roger Sanchez, Finance Director\n\n#### **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal *Suralink*, allows us to send and receive information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the City's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program - CaseWare Working Papers.\n\nBy effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we can develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of City of Shafter. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the City's employees who are granted access.\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the City which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n![](_page_30_Picture_12.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n#### **Audit Work Schedule**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP is prepared to meet the deadlines required.\n\n| Milestones | FY 2024-25 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Entrance conference | December 9, 2024 |\n| Detailed audit plan | April 7, 2025 or before |\n| Interim work | June 23, 2025 |\n| Final Fieldwork | October 6, 2025 |\n| Draft Reports and Management Letter for review | November 22, 2025 or before |\n| Final Audit Reports | December 22, 2025 or before |\n\n- *The timeline is reasonable given the totality of work involved and our managers being highly qualified and trained.

We understand that you require us to perform an audit of the financial statements of the City for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024, through June 30, 2026, with an option to extend for two (2) subsequent fiscal years, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the standards set forth for financial and compliance audits in the U.S. General Accounting Office's (GAO) Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions, the provisions of the Single Audit Act of 1984, as amended, U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, Audits of State and Local Governments, and Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Pronouncements. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- We will perform a financial and compliance audit to determine:\n\t- A. Whether the combined financial statements of the City fairly present the financial position and the results of financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\t- B. Whether the City has complied with laws and regulations that may have a material effect upon the statements.\n- We will examine the City's internal accounting controls and accounting procedures and render written reports of their findings to the City Administrator. The examination will be made and the reports rendered in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. In addition, we will communicate to the City Administrator any reportable conditions found during the audit that can be defined as either a significant or material weakness in the design or operation of the control structure, which could adversely affect the organization's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements.\n\t- A. We will make an immediate, written report of all irregularities and illegal acts or indications of illegal acts of which they become aware to an appropriate level of management.\n\t- B. We will include all funds of the City in the audit scope.\n- We will conduct a single audit in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 (as amended), generally accepted auditing standards, and generally accepted governmental auditing standards (if required).\n- We will draft ACFR in accordance with all regulatory standards and submit to the City for final approval prior to the final issuance of statements with the final audit report.\n\t- A. We will compile supplemental schedules similar to those included for the subsequent three years ACFR's and include these in the draft ACFR presented to management for review.\n\t- B. We will submit a management letter setting forth their findings and/or recommendations on those matters noted and observed during the conduct of the examination of the financial records and developed within the scope usually associated with such an examination relating to, but not limited to:\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_15.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- 1. Improvements in systems of internal control\n- 2. Improvements in accounting system\n- 3. Apparent noncompliance with laws, rules, and regulations\n- 4. Any other material matter coming to the attention of the Firm during the conduct of the examination.\n\n#### **Reports to be Issued:**\n\nWe will issue the following reports upon completion of the Audit of Financial Statements of the City:\n\n- 1. Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR).\n- 2. Single Audit Report\n- 3. Management Report\n\n#### **Other Considerations**\n\n- We will provide financial advice and counsel on matters occurring that would have an effect on subsequent ACFRs and audit reports, as requested.\n- We will be consulted as an information resource from time to time throughout the term of agreement. We will guide (upon request) on implementation of GASB requirements and specifics of federal and state regulations as they may affect local government accounting. In addition, we will assist with the implementation of any new pronouncements or statements from regulatory agencies.\n- We are committed to attend the City Council meeting to explain or clarify financial statements or accounting requirements not specifically related to the issuance of final audit reports for any given year, if requested.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_15.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the City's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the City Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the City's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the City Officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, the assistance the City may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the City Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has thew expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n#### **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the City and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to City of Sonora to aid the City's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n#### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the City's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Receipts\n- Payroll\n- Financial reporting\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state programs\n\nBased on our understanding of the City's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n#### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering the City's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the City staff and review of any City's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_19.jpeg)\n\nIT and general computer controls\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n#### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the City's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n#### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centred around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n#### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the City of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the City and successor auditors, and allow the City and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the City as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement.\n\nThe audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the City's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n#### **Anticipated Potential Audit Problems**\n\nWe understand that the adoption of new laws or accounting principles can significantly impact the audit process, and we are committed to addressing these challenges effectively. Our team of experienced auditors stays updated with the latest regulations and accounting standards to ensure compliance and accuracy in our work. We will closely monitor any changes in laws or accounting principles that may affect the audit and promptly adapt our approach to accommodate these modifications. In the event that we encounter specific complexities or require additional support, we will communicate and coordinate with the City to request any special assistance needed. We believe in fostering a collaborative relationship, and by working closely with the City, we can overcome potential hurdles and ensure a successful audit engagement. Our proposal aims to demonstrate our proactive approach to anticipating and managing audit problems, as well as our commitment to providing high-quality services while adhering to relevant laws and accounting principles.\n\n#### **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal *Suralink*, allows us to send and receive information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the City's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program - CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we can develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of City of Sonora. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the City's employees who are granted access.\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the City which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Audit Work Schedule**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP is prepared to meet the deadlines required.\n\n| Milestones | FY 2024 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Planning, risk assessment and system evaluation | Late July - Early August 2024 |\n| Interim Audit Fieldwork | 3rd week of August 2024 or before |\n| Year-End Audit Fieldwork Completed | Last week of October 2024 or before |\n| Draft Audit (ACFR) Report for review | Last week of November 2024 or before |\n| Final Audit (ACFR), Single Audit Report and |  |\n| Management Letter | December 15, 2024 or before |\n\n- *The timeline is reasonable given the totality of work involved and our managers being highly qualified and trained.

We understand that you require us to perform lease compliance auditing services of the City's lease agreements. Audits will be performed under AICPA consulting services standards or GAGAS yellow book. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks:\n\n- We will perform compliance audits as requested by the City.\n- We will gain an understanding of each contract, identify compliance risks specific to the contract, and work with the Lessee in a collaborative manner to complete the audit. Our audit procedures will be prescribed to determine whether the rent remitted to the City was accurate and complete as delineated and agreed to in the lease agreement.\n- For each audit performed we will deliver:\n\t- 1. We will develop a program for each audit that describes the audit objectives and budget. We will seek approval of the audit program before beginning fieldwork.\n\t- 2. Audit notification memo to Lessee.\n\t- 3. Opening kick-off meeting with Lessee explaining the audit purpose, scope, coordination required, and timeline.\n\t- 4. Final report containing the following; Audit Objective, Scope, Audit Methodology, Findings including calculation of revenue owed to City.\n\t- 5. Closing meeting with Lessee and City personnel.\n\t- 6. Meetings and presentations as requested by City or Lessee.\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the City's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the City Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the City's financial systems and processes.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_17.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nThis will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the City Officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the City may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the City Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n#### **Audit Methodology**\n\nTo accomplish our audit objectives, we will perform the following audit procedures:\n\n#### **1. Understanding the Scope and Objectives of the Audit**\n\n**Defining Objectives:** We will identify the key objectives of the audit, such as verifying compliance with rent payments, reporting requirements, and other operational conditions.\n\n**Reviewing Lease Agreements:** We will gather and review all lease agreements, amendments, and related documents to understand the terms and conditions, focusing on rent, reporting, maintenance, insurance, and other compliance requirements.\n\n#### **2. Plan the Audit**\n\n**Audit Planning:** We will develop a detailed audit plan outlining the steps, timelines, and resources needed. We will determine which lease terms to focus on based on the risk assessment.\n\n**Identifying Key Stakeholders:** We will identify and communicate with key stakeholders, including property managers, accountants, legal teams, and operations personnel.\n\n#### **3. Data Collection and Verification**\n\n**Gathering Documentation:** We will collect all relevant documentation, including payment records, financial statements, insurance certificates, maintenance logs, and compliance reports.\n\n**Reviewing Rent Payments:** We will verify the accuracy and timeliness of rent payments, including minimum basic rent and percentage rent, against the lease terms.\n\n**Checking Reporting Requirements:** We will ensure that financial statements and other required reports (monthly, quarterly, annual) have been submitted on time and in accordance with the lease terms.\n\n**Inspecting Onsite Safety and Maintenance:** We will evaluate compliance with onsite safety, maintenance, and upkeep obligations, and compare them with lease requirements.\n\n**Verifying Insurance Coverage:** We will review the insurance policies to confirm that the required coverage is in place and current.\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **4. Conducting Fieldwork and Testing**\n\n**Performing Site Visits:** We will conduct onsite inspections to assess physical conditions, safety compliance, and adherence to maintenance and operational requirements (if required).\n\n**Interviewing Relevant Personnel:** We will interview tenants, property managers, and other relevant parties to understand processes and identify any compliance gaps.\n\n**Testing Compliance:** We will perform tests to verify compliance with financial, operational, and insurance obligations, comparing actual performance against lease requirements.\n\n#### **5. Analyze Findings**\n\n**Comparing Against Lease Terms:** We will analyze the collected data to determine whether all terms and conditions of the lease have been met.\n\n**Identifying Discrepancies:** We will highlight any discrepancies, such as late payments, inadequate reporting, maintenance lapses, or insufficient insurance coverage.\n\n**Assessing Financial Impact:** Quantifying the financial impact of any non-compliance, such as missed rent or penalties.\n\n#### **6. Report the Results**\n\n**Preparing an Audit Report:** Compiling findings, conclusions, and recommendations into a formal audit report. Include details on compliance, deviations, and any required corrective actions.\n\n**Providing Recommendations:** We will offer recommendations to address any issues found, including suggestions for improving lease administration and monitoring.\n\n**Reviewing with Stakeholders:** Presenting the audit report to relevant stakeholders, including management, legal teams, and the tenant, and discuss the findings.\n\n#### **7. Follow-Up**\n\n**Monitoring Corrective Actions:** We will track the implementation of any corrective actions and ensure that all issues are resolved on time.\n\n**Scheduling Future Audits:** We will recommend scheduling periodic lease performance audits to ensure ongoing compliance.\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_17.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal *Suralink*, allows us to send and receive information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the City's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program - CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we can develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of City of Torrance. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the City's employees who are granted access.\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the City which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **COST PROPOSAL**\n\nOur fees are generally lower than other competing firms since we keep our overhead low; we follow a scientific audit approach and we make extensive use of emerging technologies that allow us to conduct audits efficiently.

Our standard hourly rates vary according to the degree of responsibility involved, and the experience level of the personnel assigned.\n\n#### **Manner of Payment**\n\nProgress billings will be sent on the basis of actual audit work completed during the course of the engagement. Interim billings do not cover a period of less than a calendar month.

We understand that you require us to perform an audit of expenditures for the Inyo-Mono Broadband Consortium (IMBC) activities of the County for the first grant year (February 1, 2023, through January 31, 2024), in accordance with Grant Agreement and generally accepted government accounting principles.\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the County's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the County Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the County's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the County Officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the County may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the County Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n#### **Audit Planning**\n\n#### **1.

We understand that you require us to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the County for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024, through June 30, 2026, with an option to extend for two (2) additional fiscal years, in accordance with U.S. GAAS; the standards for financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, also known as Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), promulgated in the U.S. Government Accountability Office's Government Auditing Standards. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n## **Annual Comprehensive Financial Report**\n\nWe will conduct the audit and will express an opinion on the fair presentation of the County's financial statements, including the combining and individual fund financial statements in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). We will render our auditors' report on the basic financial statements, which will include both Government-Wide Financial Statements and Fund Financial Statements.\n\n### **Single Audit**\n\nWe will perform a single audit of the County's federal award programs in accordance with the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).\n\n- We will complete the online Data Collection Form (Form) and transmit the completed Form electronically to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.\n- We will upload the Financial Statements and the Single Audit to the State Controller's Office by no later than February 15th.\n- We will provide an electronic copy of the County's financial statements and Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (Single Audit). The electronic copies will meet the most current WCAG Accessibility Standards.\n\n## **Management Letter**\n\nA management letter and/or report which discloses weaknesses in financial controls and recommendations thereon will accompany each annual financial report. The report will disclose, if any, opportunities to reduce costs, enhance revenues, and/or improve efficiency. We will prepare Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) letter for each audit, if applicable, in accordance with AU Section 380, Communication with Audit Committees, as amended.\n\n## **Gann Appropriations Limit**\n\nWe will perform an agreed upon procedures engagement for the County's annual calculation of the Appropriations Limit as prescribed by Section 1.5 of Article XIII-B of the California Constitution and Proposition 111.\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **GASB**\n\nWe will provide assistance in implementing any new changes due to new GASB standards.\n\nWe will compile and create an Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) for the County to be prepared by the independent auditor and be fully compliant with all current Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncements.\n\n### **Optional Service**\n\n- Prepare the Annual Financial Transactions Report (FTR) for State Controller's Office (SCO) for the County.\n### **Reports Requirement**\n\nUpon completion of the audit of the financial statement, we will issue the following reports:\n\n- A report on the fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n- Any other additional report required by the GASB.\n\nAs part of the Single Audit requirements, the following reports will be issued:\n\n- Independent auditor's report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards.\n- Independent auditor's report on compliance for each major federal program; report on internal control over compliance; and report on the schedule of expenditures of federal awards required by the Uniform Guidance.\n- Any other additional report required by the Uniform Guidance.\n\nOur report on applying agreed-upon procedures related to the County's annual calculation of the Appropriations Limit as prescribed by Section 1.5 of Article XIII-B of the California Constitution and Proposition 111. (The agreed-upon procedures to be performed will include the following:\n\n- Annual Appropriations Limit was calculated as required by Section 1.5 of Article XIII-B of the California Constitution and Proposition 111.\n### **Other Requirements**\n\nWe will provide, such additional report schedules, exhibits, or other information to any completed and filed audit report as may be required by a cognizant agency, grantor, or administrative agency upon review of the Single Audit report.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_19.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged.\n\nWe have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted. Our plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the County's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the County Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the County's financial systems and processes.\n\nThis will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the County Officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the County may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the County Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n# **METHODOLOGY**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the County and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to County of Mendocino to aid the County's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the County's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Journal entry process Federal and state programs\n- Receipts\n- IT and general computer controls\n- Payroll\n- Financial reporting\n\nBased on our understanding of the County's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included\n\nin a formal management letter.\n\n### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n## **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the County's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n## **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_26.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n### **Rules and Regulations**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP will meet all specific requirements imposed by state or local law or rules and regulations. We will review the laws and regulations covering the County's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the County staff and review of any County's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the County of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the County and successor auditors, and allow the County and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance. We will make audit work papers available upon your request to the following parties or their designees:\n\n- Mendocino County Grand Jury\n- Auditor-Controller Office\n- U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)\n- Parties designated by federal or state agencies or by the County as part of an audit quality review process\n- Auditor of agencies of which the County is a sub-recipient of grant funds\n\n## **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink* gives us the capability of sending and receiving information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the County's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program; CaseWare Working Papers.\n\nBy effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we are able to develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of County of Mendocino. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the County's employees who are granted access.\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient, it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfillment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the County which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **MANAGEMENT PLAN**\n\n## **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the County as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities.\n\nBy reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the County's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members. At the completion of the interim work, we will provide a management letter to the Superintendent (or designee) detailing all findings and recommendations noted as of the date of the completion of the interim work. We may substitute a copy of all written findings for the management letter.\n\n### **Supervisory Review and Quality Control Procedures**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP will provide progress reporting on at least a monthly basis to the County and will summarize the results of fieldwork and review significant findings on the last day of fieldwork or shortly thereafter.

Standard of Care. Consultant agrees to perform the work in a professional manner and in a manner consistent with that degree of skill and care ordinarily exercised by members of the same profession currently practicing under similar circumstances at the same time and in the same or similar locality.

Subconsultants. Consultant is as responsible for the performance of its subconsultants as it would be if it had rendered these services itself. Consultant shall not subcontract any portion of the performance contemplated and provided for in this Agreement, other than\n\nto the subconsultants noted in Consultant's proposal, without prior written approval of the District.

Consultant may rely on the information provided by District but only to the extent such reliance is consistent with Consultant's obligations under this Agreement.\n\n# 6. Acceptance.\n\nThe District's review, approval, or acceptance of Consultant's work shall not relieve Consultant from responsibility for error and omissions in Consultant's work. Consultant shall, at no cost to District, satisfactorily correct any and all errors, omissions, deficiencies, or conflicts in the documents prepared by Consultant promptly upon discovery or notice. The obligations of Consultant to correct defective or nonconforming work shall not limit any other obligations of Consultant.\n\n#### 7.

Payment.\n\nDistrict hereby agrees to pay Consultant a sum not to exceed $___________________,\n\nnotwithstanding any contrary indications that may be contained in Consultant's proposal, for services to be performed and reimbursable costs incurred under this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Scope of Work, attached as **Exhibit A,** or Consultant's compensation rate schedule attached as **Exhibit B,** regarding the amount of compensation, the text of the Agreement shall prevail. All reimbursable expenses incurred by Consultant as part of this Agreement will be reimbursed at actual cost and in no event shall expenses be advanced by District to Consultant. Such compensation shall be full payment to Consultant (including expenses) for performance of said services; provided, however, that in no event shall the sum of total compensation paid Consultant and reimbursable expense exceed the amount not to exceed amount stated in this section without a written amendment signed by both Parties.\n\nConsultant and District acknowledge and agree that compensation paid by District to Consultant under this Agreement is based upon Consultant's estimated costs of providing the services required hereunder, including salaries and benefits of employees and subcontractors of Consultant. Consequently, the parties further agree that compensation hereunder is intended to include the costs of contributions to any pensions and/or annuities to which Consultant and its employees, agents, and subcontractors may be eligible. District therefore has no responsibility for such contributions beyond compensation required under this Agreement.\n\n- 9.

Such notice shall include an estimate of the time necessary to complete work described\n\nin Exhibit A and the estimate of time necessary to complete work under any other agreement between Consultant and District, if applicable.\n\n- g. The amount and purpose of actual expenditures for which reimbursement is sought;\n- h. The Consultant's signature.\n\nConsultant shall submit his/her compensable hours and reimbursable expenses monthly, and District shall make payments on the approved compensation and reimbursable expenses within forty-five (45) days. In no event shall Consultant submit any invoice for an amount in excess of the maximum amount of compensation provided in this Agreement, unless this Agreement is modified prior to the submission of such an invoice by a properly executed change order or amendment.\n\n# 10. Termination of Agreement for Convenience.\n\nDistrict may terminate the whole or any part of this Agreement for convenience and without cause at any time. In such event, District shall give written notice of such termination. In the event of termination under this section, Consultant shall have the right to expend reasonable additional time to assemble work in progress for the purpose of proper filing and closing the job. Prior to expending said time, Consultant shall present to District, a complete report of said proposed job closure and its costs, and District may approve all or any part of said expense.

All charges thus incurred and approved by District, together with any other charges outstanding at the time of termination, shall be payable by District within thirty (30) days following submission of a final statement by Consultant.\n\n#### 11. Consultant as Independent Contractor.\n\nIt is expressly agreed that in the performance of the services necessary to carry out this Agreement, Consultant shall be, and is, an independent contractor, and is not an agent or employee of District. Consultant has and shall retain the right to exercise full control and supervision of the services, and full control over the employment, direction, compensation and discharge of all persons assisting him/her in the performance of his/her services hereunder. Consultant shall be solely responsible for all matters relating to the payment of his/her employees, including compliance with social security, withholding, and all other regulations governing such matters, and shall be solely responsible for his/her own acts and those of his/her subordinates, sub-consultants, agents and employees.\n\n# 12. Brokers: Compliance with Federal, State and Municipal Statutes.\n\nConsultant warrants that he/she has not employed nor retained any broker, agent, company or person other than bona fide, full-time employees of Consultant working solely for Consultant, to solicit or secure this Agreement, and that he/she has not paid nor agreed to pay any broker, agent, company, nor persons other than bona fide employees any fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gifts, or any other consideration, contingent upon or resulting from the award of this Agreement. Consultant shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless District, its directors, officers, and employees from such claims.\n\n#### 13. Compliance with Laws.\n\nConsultant shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations applicable to his/her work hereunder. Consultant shall use its professional judgment and expertise to verify interpretations of applicable law, codes, regulations, and ordinances, from the appropriate Government Agency(s) and authorities having jurisdiction over the Project. Such efforts will be undertaken in accordance with the acceptable standard of care for this type of Project. Where applicable, Consultant shall comply with all mitigation measures identified in the Project's environmental review documents.\n\n## 14. Grant Funding.\n\nTo the extent that this Agreement may be funded by fiscal assistance from another governmental entity or public grant program, Consultant and any subconsultants shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations to which District is bound by the terms of such fiscal assistance program.\n\n#### 15. Nondiscrimination.\n\nDuring the performance of this Agreement, Consultant and Consultant's sub-consultants agree as follows:\n\n- a. Contractor and Contractor's subcontractors will not discriminate against any employee or qualified applicant for employment on the basis of any legally protected classification including but not limited to sex, race, gender identity, creed, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, ethnic group identification, age, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or sexual orientation. Contractor and any subcontractors agree to comply with all nondiscrimination requirements for public contracting under State and Federal law. Contractor and Contractor's subcontractors will take affirmative steps to ensure that qualified applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their sex, race, gender identity, creed, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, ethnic group identification, age, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation or any other legally protected classification. This equal treatment will apply but not be limited to, the following: upgrade, demotion, transfer, recruitment, recruitment advertising, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and selection for training, including apprenticeship. Contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices setting forth the provision of this non-discrimination clause.\n- b. Contractor and Contractor's subcontractors will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of Contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to sex, race, gender identity, creed, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, ethnic group identification, age, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, or any other legally protected classification.\n\n- c. Contractor and Contractor's subcontractors will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he/she has a collective bargaining agreement or contract or understanding, a notice advising the labor union or workers' representative of Contractor's commitments under this non-discrimination clause.\n#### 16. Labor Code/Prevailing Wages.\n\nTo the extent applicable, Consultant and Consultant's subconsultants shall comply with the requirements of the California Labor Code including but not limited to hours of labor, nondiscrimination, payroll records, apprentices, workers' compensation, and payment of prevailing wages as determined by the Director of California Department of Industrial Relations, pursuant to the Director's authority under Labor Code Section 1770 et seq. To the extent applicable, Consultant shall post a copy of the prevailing rate of per diem wages at each job site. Consultant shall forfeit fifty dollars ($50) for each calendar day or portion thereof for each worker paid less than the stipulated prevailing rates for any public work done under the Agreement by it or any subconsultant.\n\nAn error on the part of an awarding body does not relieve the Consultant from responsibility for payment of the prevailing rate of per diem wages and penalties pursuant to Labor Code Sections 1770-1775. The District will not recognize any claim for additional compensation because of the payment by the Consultant for any wage rate in excess of prevailing wage rate set forth. The possibility of wage increases is one of the elements to be considered by the Consultant. Consultant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the District for any costs, claims and expenses arising from the failure of Consultant or Consultant's subconsultants to pay applicable prevailing wage rates.\n\n#### 17. Indemnification.\n\n- a. Separate Professional Liability (PL) Indemnity. To the fullest extent permitted by law, including without limitation California Civil Code Section 2782 and 2782.8, and with respect to the performance of professional services, Consultant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless District, its officers, employees, authorized agents/volunteers, and invitees (collectively, the \"District Indemnitees\"), from and against any claims, damages, losses, demands, liabilities, judgments, settlements, expenses, and costs (including reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) to the extent caused by Consultant's negligent acts, errors or omissions or willful misconduct in the performance of services under this Agreement and anyone for whom Consultant is legally liable. Consultant has no obligation to pay for any of District Indemnitees defense related cost prior to a final determination of liability, or to pay any amount that exceeds Consultant's finally determined percentage of liability based upon the comparative fault of Consultant.\n- b. Separate Other than Professional Liability (OPL) Indemnity. As respect to its operations, other than the performance of professional services, Consultant agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend District with counsel approved by District, the District Indemnitees, from and against any damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs, claims, demands, actions, suits, losses, and expenses (including\n\nreasonable and necessary attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) arising out of the death or bodily injury to any person or destruction or damage to any property, to the extent caused by Consultant's negligent acts, errors or omissions or willful misconduct in the performance of services under this Agreement and anyone for whom Consultant is legally liable.\n\n- c. Common PL & OPL Indemnity Provisions. Consultant's obligations under this Section 17 shall not apply when (1) the injury, loss of life, damage to property, or violation of law arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the District or its officers, employees, agents, or volunteers and (2) the actions of Consultant or its employees, subcontractor, or agents have contributed in no part to the injury, loss of life, damage to property, or violation of law. It is understood that the duty of Consultant to indemnify and hold harmless under Section 17(b) includes the duty to defend as set forth in Section 2778 of the California Civil Code. Acceptance by District of insurance certificates and endorsements required under this Agreement does not relieve Consultant from liability under this indemnification and hold harmless clause. This indemnification and hold harmless clause shall apply to any damages or claims for damages whether or not such insurance policies shall have been determined to apply. By execution of this Agreement, Consultant acknowledges and agrees to the provisions of this Section and that it is a material element of consideration.\n- d. In the event that Consultant or any employee, agent, or subcontractor of Consultant providing services under this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or the California Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) to be eligible for enrollment in PERS as an employee of District, Consultant shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless District for the payment of any employee and/or employer contributions for PERS benefits on behalf of Consultant or its employees, agents, or subcontractors, as well as for the payment of any penalties and interest on such contributions, which would otherwise be the responsibility of District.\n\n#### 18.

Best Company and which are acceptable to District. Consultant shall, fifteen (15) days prior to the commencement of this Agreement and prior to the termination of any policy, supply District with a certificate, on the District's certificate of insurance form, showing that such insurance is in force.\n- (1) Consultant shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain Statutory Workers' Compensation Insurance and Employer's Liability Insurance for any and all persons employed directly or indirectly by Consultant. The Statutory Workers' Compensation Insurance and Employer's Liability Insurance shall be provided with limits of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per accident. In the alternative, Consultant may\n\nrely on a self-insurance program to meet those requirements, but only if the program of self-insurance complies fully with the provisions of the California Labor Code.

The insurer, if insurance is provided, or the Consultant, if a program of self-insurance is provided, shall waive all rights of subrogation against the District and its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers for loss arising from work performed under this Agreement.\n\n- (2) Commercial General Liability (\"CGL\") (bodily injury and property damage) on an occurrence basis in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and at least two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate, including premises and operations (including off-site operations), blanket contractual liability, broad form property damage, products and completed operations, owner's and Consultant's protective liability, (and if one or more of the following is applicable) personal injury, coverage for explosion, collapse and underground hazards, nonowned watercraft protection and indemnity, U.S. longshore and harbor workers coverage, pollution liability, liquor liability, and saddle animal liability.\n- (3) Automobile Liability (bodily injury and property damage) in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence extending to owned, non-owned and hired vehicles and including contractual liability covering all liability assumed under Agreement.\n- (4) Professional Liability Insurance (errors and omissions), including contractual liability, in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate. Such coverage may be written on a claims-made basis.\n- b. Each of the above policies must contain a provision that the policy shall not be cancelled or the terms or conditions thereof materially changed without thirty (30) days' prior written notice to District. No cancellation provision in any insurance policy shall be construed in derogation of the continuous duty of Consultant to furnish the required insurance during the term of this Agreement.\n- c. Upon written request by District, the insurer or his/her agent will furnish a copy of any policy cited above, certified to be a true and complete copy of the original.\n- d. The policies listed under a(1) above shall contain a waiver of subrogation in favor of the District.\n- e. The policies listed under a(2) and a(3) above shall name the District as an additional insured with respect to the operations performed under this Agreement.\n- f. The coverage afforded on behalf of District under a(2), a(3) and a(4) above shall be primary insurance and any other insurance available to District under any other policies shall be excess over the insurance outlined above.\n- g. Upon written request of District, annual loss reports will be supplied to District.

Consultant certifies that he/she is aware of the provisions of Section 3700 of the California Labor Code, which requires every employer to be insured against liability for Workers' Compensation or to undertake self-insurance in accordance with the provisions of that Code. Consultant shall comply with the provisions of Section 3700 of the Labor Code before commencing the performance of the work under this Agreement.\n- k. Consultant shall require and verify that all subconsultants maintain insurance meeting all the requirements stated herein.\n- l. In case of the breach of any provision of this section, District may, in addition to any other remedies it may have, at District's option, take out and maintain, at the expense of Consultant, such types of insurance in the name of the Consultant as District may deem proper and may deduct the cost of taking out and maintaining such insurance from any sums which may be found or become due to Consultant under this Agreement or may demand Consultant to promptly reimburse the District.\n\n#### 19. Default.\n\nIn the event that Consultant defaults in any obligation of Consultant under this Agreement, or Consultant defaults in the performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Consultant does not cure its failure to perform to the satisfaction of the District within ten (10) days (or such time authorized by the District in writing) after written notice by the District, District may, at its option, declare this Agreement to be in default and, at any time thereafter, may do any one or more of the following:\n\n- a.

Any records or documents required to be maintained under this section shall be made available to District for inspection and copying upon request.

Assignment.\n\nDistrict and Consultant recognize and agree that this Agreement contemplates personal performance by Consultant and is based upon a determination of Consultant's unique personal competence, experience, and specialized personal knowledge.

Specific Audit Approach** (RFP Page 6, Section V, B.6)\n\n## **Scope of the Work**\n\nAt Harshwal & Company, LLP, our professionals have extensive experience performing audits of special districts and our team has a broad understanding of the work environment that is necessary to conduct an audit of the East Bay Regional Park District. We understand that you require us to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the Park District for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2024, through December 31, 2026, with an option to extend for two additional years, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and the standards set for financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the provisions of the Federal Single Audit Act, as amended, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- We will perform an audit of the basic financial statements of the Park District;\n- We will express our opinion on the financial statements as to whether they present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Park District and the changes in financial position and cash flows (where applicable) in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and will issue an independent auditors' report stating this opinion;\n- We will test internal controls over financial reporting and compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and issue a report on their consideration;\n- We will prepare the pension plans worksheets and conversion entries from the actuary valuation reports pursuant to GASB Statements No. 68 for the note disclosures and Required Supplementary Information;\n- We will prepare the OPEB plan conversion entries from the actuary valuation reports pursuant to GASB Statements No. 75;\n- We will apply limited procedures related to the Required Supplementary Information (RSI), Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), budgetary comparison information, and the Supplementary Information;\n- We will prepare report to Board of Directors and management which identifies control deficiencies, significant deficiencies and material weaknesses;\n- We will perform agreed upon procedures on the appropriation limit under Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, and issue related report;\n- We will complete Single Audit of federal expenditures in compliance with audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), and issue report on compliance with requirements applicable to each major program and internal control, as well as a report on compliance and on internal control over financial reporting based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards;\n\n![](_page_19_Picture_14.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- We will meet with the Board Finance Committee (without the presence of Finance Department staff) to discuss the outcomes of the annual audit also present and discuss annual financial statement and results of operations to the Finance Committee during the June meeting;\n- We will immediately communicate in writing all irregularities and illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, of which we become aware, to the General Manager and the Assistant General Manager of Finance and Management Services;\n- We will provide general consultation as required, during the year, on financial reporting matters, including implementation any new GASB statements that are relevant to the Park District; and\n- As requested by the bond financing team, we will issue a \"consent and citation of expertise\" as the auditor and any necessary \"comfort letters\" in relationship to Park District financials statements and auditors' report, which are included in the Official Statement prepared in connection with sale of debt securities.\n\n# **Understanding of the Project to be Performed**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the Park District's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the Park District's Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the Park District's financial systems and processes.\n\nThis will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the Park District Officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the Park District may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the Park District's Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Specific Audit Approach (Segmentation of the Audit Work & Audit Methodology)**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n# **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the Park District and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to East Bay Regional Park District to aid the Park District's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n# **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the Park District's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n# **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Receipts\n- Payroll\n- Financial reporting\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state programs\n- IT and general computer controls\n\nBased on our understanding of the Park District's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n# **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the Park District's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n# **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n# **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n### **Rules and Regulations**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP will meet all specific requirements imposed by state or local law or rules and regulations. We will review the laws and regulations covering the Park District's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the Park District staff and review of any Park District's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the Park District of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the Park District and successor auditors, and allow the Park District and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance. We will make audit work papers available upon your request.\n\n### **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink* gives us the capability of sending and receiving information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the Park District's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program; CaseWare Working Papers.\n\nBy effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we are able to develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of East Bay Regional Park District. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the Park District's employees who are granted access.\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the Park District which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n# **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the Park District as the work proceeds and once on complete of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities.\n\nBy reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the Park District's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members. At the completion of the interim work, we will provide a management letter to the Superintendent (or designee) detailing all findings and recommendations noted as of the date of the completion of the interim work. We may substitute a copy of all written findings for the management letter.\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **Audit Preparation Letter for Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 20XX (This is the preliminary Audit Preparation Letter; we will request additional information for our testing, if required).**\n\n **Due Date Not Set**\n\n| Category Name |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| General Procedures |  |\n|  | Copies of minutes of board meetings from beginning of the fiscal year to three months subsequent to |\n| close of fiscal year. |  |\n|  | Any transactions occur between the District and a related party (Governing Board member, employees |\n| and immediate family members, vendors, trust, etc.) |  |\n| Trial Balance |  |\n|  | Copy of working fundwise trial balance as of fiscal year end date.

Blue Arrow, Inc is our current year auditors, and they performed our fiscal year 2020 audit. We found their overall services to be excellent and professional. Blue Arrow, Inc. was able to complete our financial audit within our required timeframe and within the allocated budget.\n\nBlue Arrow, Inc. offers a unique perspective and approach to auditing financial records and transactions. They take their time to fully understand the individual nuances of similar, but distinct reporting entities. As a newly established tribally designated housing entity, Blue Arrow, Inc. was able to understand how our entity transitioned, operates, and suggested recommendations to help our organization enhance our current financial management.\n\nBlue Arrow, Inc. staff was thorough in conducting our financial audit and provided excellent customer service through their ability to work with us, making time to discuss our concerns and responded to our questions in a timely manner.\n\nCordially,\n\nGreta Armijo Executive Director\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_13.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **WORK PROPOSAL AND APPROACH (AUDIT APPROACH)**\n\n#### **Scope of the Work to be Performed:**\n\nAt Blue Arrow CPAs our professionals have extensive experience performing audits of housing authorities. Our team has a broad understanding of the standards and requirements necessary to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the KIHA. We understand that you require us to perform an audit of financial statement and single audit of the KIHA for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, through September 30, 2026, with an option to extend for two (2) additional years, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in *Government Auditing Standards*, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the single audit requirements of 2 CFR 200 Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, and State of Alaska Single Audit in accordance with provisions of State of Alaska 2 AAC 45.010 regulations, as appropriate to the particular entity. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- We will conduct an audit of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and the standards for financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.\n- We will conduct an audit of the KIHA's financial statements in accordance with the Single Audit requirements of 2 CFR 200 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\n- We will perform auditing procedures on the KIHA's financial statements in accordance with State provisions of the State Single Audit Act, State of Alaska 2 AAC 45.010.\n- Financial audit services will cover the KIHA's operations from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, for the following programs: NAHASDA (Low Rent, Mutual Help, Modernization, Rehabilitation, Development, and Rental Assistance), Enterprise (Harborview, Cliffwood, & Emerald Heights Apartments) and the Loan Program.\n- We will assist in the preparation of the financial statements and express an opinion on the financial condition of the KIHA and its systems of internal financial controls.\n- Presentation of the audit will be made to the Board of Commissioners of the KIHA during a scheduled BOC Meeting. This will be done via teleconference.\n- Upon completion of the reports, the reporting package will be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearing House (FAC).\n- We will provide technical assistance as requested by the KIHA throughout the year concerning accounting transactions, generally accepted accounting principles, tax-related questions, new business start-up, and reporting requirements as deemed appropriate by KIHA staff.\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_13.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the KIHA's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the KIHA Manager and Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the KIHA's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements.\n\nThe meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the KIHA officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the KIHA may need from us and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the KIHA officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from the staff.\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n### **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the KIHA and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to Kodiak Island Housing Authority to aid the KIHA's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n#### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the KIHA's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control testing.\n\n### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Cash receipts\n- Payroll\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state programs\n- Financial reporting\n- IT and general computer controls\n\nBased on our understanding of the KIHA's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing.\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_20.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nOur substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the KIHA's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n#### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance):**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of a population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population.\n\n#### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering the KIHA's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing, if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the KIHA staff and review of any KIHA's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n## **Working Paper Retention:**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the KIHA of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the KIHA and successor auditors, and allow the KIHA and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_19.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_30_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the KIHA as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency and to spot emerging needs or opportunities.\n\nBy reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the KIHA's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n#### **Proposed Segmentation of the Engagement and Timeline:**\n\nOutlined below is an expected timeline and completion of the audit and the expected delivery of the financial statements and management letter; this timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing your accounting records\n\n| Milestones | Timeframes for FY 2024 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Planning, risk assessment and system evaluation | Late September or early October, 2024 |\n| Interim audit fieldwork | 2nd week of October, 2024 |\n| Final audit fieldwork and audit work to be completed | Last week of November, 2024 or before |\n| Draft audit report and management letter for review | 2nd week of December, 2024 or before |\n| Final audit report and management letter | Last week of December, 2024 or before |\n\n *This timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing dates of your accounting records.*\n\n- *The timeline is reasonable given the totality of work involved, and our managers being highly qualified and trained.*\n![](_page_30_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n# **PROPOSED FEES**\n\nOur fees are generally lower than other competing firms since we keep our overhead low; we follow a scientific audit approach and we make extensive use of emerging technologies that allow us to conduct audits efficiently. Our policy is to provide you exceptional service that meets and exceeds professional auditing standards at a competitive cost.\n\n*Summarized below are the professional fees for the KIHA's audit services for the FY ending September 30, 2024, through September 30, 2026:*\n\n| Audit Area - Description |  | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2026 |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Professional fees: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Financial Statement and Single Audit | $ | 8,000.00 | $ 8,400.00 | $ | 8,820.00 |\n| Total fees | $ | 8,000.00 | $ 8,400.00 | $ | 8,820.00 |\n\n- *Single audit fees are calculated as per the number of major programs.

Our fees for the additional services, if required, will be based on the actual time spent by professional or administrative personnel at quoted hourly rates, specified above. Our standard hourly rates vary according to the degree of responsibility involved, and the experience level of the personnel assigned.\n\n#### **Manner of Payment**\n\nProgress billings will be sent on the basis of actual audit work completed during the course of the engagement. Interim billings do not cover a period of less than a calendar month. We view this work as being every bit as important and valuable as the work we perform for other clients and we put our best people on it. Any consulting work you request will be performed at the same rates as our audit work.\n\n![](_page_31_Figure_14.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Benefits of Choosing Blue Arrow CPAs**\n\nBlue Arrow CPAs is recognized for its professionalism, integrity, and for providing clients with effective resolutions for their unique circumstances and issues.

The Net Promoter Score was developed by Bain consultant and author Frederick Reicheld.

The Agreement will be signed by the Contractor and returned within ten (10) business days of receipt of the Agreement. The period for execution may be changed by mutual agreement of the parties. Agreements are not effective, and work must not be performed, until the Agreement is signed by a person holding the required authority for both parties and full approval by OVCDC including the OVCDC Human Resources and Finance Departments.\n\nFailure of Contractor to execute the Agreement within the time frame identified above will be sufficient cause for voiding the award of the Agreement. If a successful person or business submitting a proposal refuses or fails to execute the Agreement, OVCDC may award the Agreement to the next qualified person or business submitting a proposal.\n\n### **XII. INTERVIEWS**\n\nAn interview/presentation may be conducted with a person or business submitting a proposal(s) selected as finalists to offer an opportunity for the person or business submitting a proposal(s) to present the proposal and explain or clarify aspects of the proposal.

This procedure is in compliance with the independence requirements of all regulatory agencies and, specifically, in compliance with the Standard for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, and Activity Functions, as published by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO). If selected as your audit firm, we will maintain and monitor our independence as well as reassess our independence with respect to your organization on an annual basis. We will continue to evaluate our independence as your external auditors and will give the OVCDC written notice of any professional relationships involving the OVCDC, if entered into, during the period of the audit contract.\n\n#### **Desk & Field Reviews**\n\nFrom time to time, selected Blue Arrow CPA's audit engagements are subject to a desk review by federal or other regulators.

This information underscores our commitment to transparency, growth, and sustained excellence in our service delivery.\n\n#### *The company's Financial Statements contain critical information. We will make it available separately upon your request.*\n\n![](_page_7_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **APPROACH**\n\n### **Scope of Work**:\n\nAt Blue Arrow CPA's, our professionals have extensive experience performing audits of tribes and tribal governments. Our team has a broad understanding of the standards and requirements necessary to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the OVCDC. We understand that you require us to perform a financial and compliance audit of the financial statements of the OVCDC for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, with an option to extend for four (4) additional years, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and Federal Government standards contained in Uniform Guidance, Subpart F (2 CFR Part 200; 45 CFR Part 75) and professional standards set forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) applicable to audits of State, Local and Tribal Governments and non-profit organizations; and the Single Audit Act of 1984, P.L. 98-502; and the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, P.L. 104-156. We will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- We will perform the financial and compliance audit of the financial statements of the OVCDC.\n- We will perform the Single Audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-502) and the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L.104-156).\n- We will keep the OVCDC apprised of any and all changes in accounting and reporting requirements along with we will provide consultation during the year.\n- We will prepare the financial statements and all related Notes.\n- We will provide a signed Audited Final Revenue and Expenditure Report and/or verification report of revenue and expenditures for the State of California, OVCDC Kern American Indian Education Center (KIEC) Grant for the period October 1 through September 30 as requested by the granting agency each year.\n- Upon completion of an audit, we will provide the following to OVCDC's Director of Finance:\n\t- I. One (1) preliminary draft\n\t- II. Ten (10) final bound copies\n\t- III. One (1) electronic copy\n\n![](_page_8_Picture_14.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_9_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted. Our plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the OVCDC's audit committee and management.\n\nDuring this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress of the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the OVCDC's Manager and Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the OVCDC's financial systems and processes.\n\nThis will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the OVCDC officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the OVCDC may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the OVCDC officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n## **SPECIFIC AUDIT APPROACH**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide a level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the OVCDC and review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to Owens Valley Career Development Center to aid the OVCDC's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n![](_page_9_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_10_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the OVCDC's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements Financial reporting\n- Cash receipts Federal and state programs\n- Payroll IT and general computer controls\n- Journal entry process\n\nBased on our understanding of the OVCDC's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n#### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance):**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering OVCDC's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing, if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with OVCDC staff and review of any OVCDC's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n#### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n![](_page_10_Picture_23.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an Independent reviewer, audit manager, and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the OVCDC's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for review and distribution of reports.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of a population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n#### **Working Paper Retention**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the OVCDC of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the OVCDC and successor auditors, and allow the OVCDC and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance. We will make working papers available, upon request, to the following parties or their designees:\n\n- OVCDC management including the Board Chair, Executive Director, and Director of Finance;\n- United States Department of Health and Human Services,\n- California State Department of Social Services,\n- United States Department of Education,\n- United States Comptroller General,\n- Parties designated by OVCDC and the federal or state government agency representatives as part of an audit or quality review process audit.\n\n## **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink*, allows us to send and receive information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the OVCDC's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through use of the paperless audit program - CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we can develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of the Owens Valley Career Development Center. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame.\n\n![](_page_11_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the OVCDC as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures.\n\nIt is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency and to spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. If we will become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the OVCDC's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n#### **Production/Delivery Schedule**\n\nBlue Arrow CPA's is prepared to meet the deadlines required.\n\n| Milestones | Timeframes |\n| --- | --- |\n| Planning, risk assessment and system evaluation | July 2024 |\n| Audit Fieldwork Commence | 3ed week of July, 2024 or before |\n| Final Audit Fieldwork | Last week of September, 2024 or before |\n| Draft Audit Report & Management Letter for Review | 2nd week of October, 2024 or before |\n| Final Audit Report & Management Letter | Last week of October, 2024 or before |\n\n- *The timeline is reasonable given the totality of work involved, and our managers being highly qualified and trained. We will follow the same system to get work done throughout the engagement.*\n- *This timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing dates of your accounting records.*\n\n![](_page_12_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Technologies Used to Perform Our Audits**\n\nWe are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows: We use the latest technical tools and technology to audit computerized systems. The following are some of the latest tools, which describe our proficiency in audits of computerized environments.\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System.** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called **Suralink**. **Suralink**'s dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination.\n\nIt means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the OVCDC's employees who are granted access. You, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient, it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The **Suralink** dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment.\n\nWith this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the OVCDC which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n**CaseWare and CaseView:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper. CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n![](_page_13_Picture_12.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_14_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**Checkpoints Tools:** All Checkpoint Tools come with a complete set of practice aids, including valuable industry-specific practical considerations and guidance. We make sure you have everything you need to complete engagements and tax preparation with ease. Checkpoint Tools provides accounting and audit professionals with valuable industry-specific practical considerations and guidance including SMART Practice Aids\u00ae Audit Suite, PPC's Practice Aids\u2122, PPC's Workpapers\u2122, PPC's Interactive Disclosure Libraries\u2122 and more. These tools work alone or with all paperless engagement products and integrate with AdvanceFlow\u2122 and Workpapers CS, part of the CS Professional Suite from Thomson Reuters.\n\n![](_page_14_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_15_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE**\n\nThe expertise and experience of Blue Arrow CPA's president, principal, and personnel are at the core of the firm's excellence in performing audits of tribes and tribal governments.

Port Hueneme, CA 93041**\n\n## **Port Hueneme Water Agency Request for Proposal Professional Auditing Services**\n\n## I. *INTRODUCTION*\n\n## A. **General Information**\n\nThe Port Hueneme Water Agency (PHWA) is requesting proposals from qualified certified public accounting firms to audit PHWA for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2025, June 30, 2026, and June 30, 2027, with the option of auditing each of two (2) subsequent years as further discussed below. These audits are to be performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.\n\nThere is no expressed or implied obligation for PHWA to reimburse responding firms for any expenses incurred in preparing proposals in response to this request. Materials submitted by respondents are subject to public inspection under the California Public Records Act (Government Code Sec. 6250 et seq.), unless exempt. Any language purporting to render the entire proposal confidential or proprietary will be ineffective and will be disregarded.\n\nAll property rights, including publication rights of all reports produced by proposer in connection with services performed under this agreement, shall be vested in PHWA. The proposer shall not publish or release any of the results of its examination without the expressed written permission of PHWA.\n\nDuring the evaluation process the Audit Committee and/or the Board of Directors reserve the right - where it may service Port Hueneme Water Agency's best interests - to request additional information or clarifications from the proposer. At the discretion of the Port Hueneme Water Agency, firms submitting proposals may be requested to make oral presentations as part of the evaluation process.\n\nPHWA reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted and to use any ideas in a proposal regardless of whether the proposal was selected. Submission of a proposal indicates acceptance by the firm of the conditions contained in this request for proposals, unless clearly and specifically noted otherwise in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between PHWA and the firm selected.\n\nIt is anticipated the selection of a firm will be completed by **September** 16, **2024**. Following the notification of the selected firm, it is expected a contract will be executed between both parties by **October** 1, **2024.** PHWA reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, to waive any non-material irregularities or information in any proposal, and to accept or reject any items or combination of items.\n\n## B. **Term of Engagement**\n\nIt is the intent of PHWA to contract for the services presented herein for a term of three (3) years. PHWA reserves the right to extend the term of this contract for two (2) additional one-year terms subject to the annual review and recommendation of the Audit Committee and/or the Board of Directors, the satisfactory negotiation of terms (including a price acceptable to both PHWA and the selected firm), the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Port Hueneme Water Agency and the annual availability of an appropriation.\n\n### **C. Subcontracting**\n\nShould any firm submitting a proposal consider subcontracting portions of the engagement, that fact must be clearly identified in the proposal along with the name of the proposed subcontracting firm(s). Following the award of the audit contract, no additional subcontracting will be allowed without the express written consent of the Board of Directors of the Port Hueneme Water Agency.\n\nThe proposal package shall present all-inclusive audit fees for each year of the contract term.\n\n# II. *NATURE OF SERVICES REQUIRED*\n\n## A. **Scope of the Work to be Performed**\n\nPHWA's goal is to provide the public and our constituents with financial statements that give complete, accurate and understandable information about the financial condition of PHWA. The selected independent auditor will be required to perform the following tasks:\n\n- 1. The audit firm shall perform an audit of PHWA. The audit will be conducted in accordance with GAAS and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in the GAGAS, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The audit firm shall express an opinion on the annual financial statements, as to whether they present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PHWA and the changes in financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and issue an Independent Auditor's Report stating this opinion. The audit firm shall apply limited audit procedures to Management's Discussion and Analysis and required supplementary information.\n- 2. The audit firm shall issue a separate \"management letter\" that includes recommendations for improvements in internal control, accounting procedures and other significant observations that are considered to be non-reportable conditions.\n- 3. The audit firm shall present and discuss annual financial statements and results of operations to the PHWA Board of Directors upon PHWA's request.\n- 4. The firm selected may also be asked to examine other reports or perform other services as required.\n\n## B. **Auditing Standards to be Followed**\n\nTo meet the requirements of this request for proposal, the audit shall be performed in accordance with:\n\n- 1. **Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS)**as set forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n- 2. The standards applicable to financial audits contained in the most current version of the **Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.**\n\n## 3. **Reports to be Issued**\n\nFollowing completion of the audit the auditor shall issue:\n\n- 1. Reports on the fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with GAGAS as listed below:\n\t- a) General Purpose Financial Statements for PHWA.\n- 2. A report based on the auditor's understanding of the internal control structure and assessment of control risk of PHWA. In this report, the auditor will also communicate any reportable conditions found during the audit and indicate whether they are also material weaknesses.\n- 3. A Management Letter addressed to the PHWA Board of Directors of PHWA setting forth recommendations (as applicable) for improvements in PHWA's accounting systems.\n- 4. The auditor shall communicate in a letter to PHWA any reportable conditions found during the audit. A reportable condition shall be defined as a significant deficiency in the design or operation of the internal control structure, which could adversely affect the organization's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements. \"Non-reportable conditions,\" discovered by the auditor shall be communicated in the \"Management Letter\".\n- 5. Auditors shall be required to make immediate, written notification to the Board of Directors of PHWA of all irregularities and illegal acts or indications of illegal acts of which they become aware.\n\n#### D. **Other Communications**\n\nThe independent auditor shall make all communications to the Audit Committee required by the audit standards under which the engagement is performed. Those communications include, but are not limited to:\n\n- 1. The auditor's responsibility under GAAP.\n- 2. Significant accounting policies.\n- 3. Management judgment and accounting estimates.\n- 4. Significant audit adjustments.\n- 5. Other information in documents containing audited financial statements.\n- 6. Disagreements with management.\n- 7.

SPECIFIC AUDIT APPROACH**\n\n## **Scope of the Work**\n\nAt Harshwal & Company, LLP, our professionals have extensive experience performing audits of special districts and our team has a broad understanding of the work environment that is necessary to conduct an audit of the Port Hueneme Water Agency. We understand that you require us to conduct an audit of the financial statement of the PHWA, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2025, through June 30, 2027, with an option to extend for two additional years, in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) in the United States of America as set forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and we will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- We will perform an audit of the PHWA and will express an opinion on the annual financial statements, as to whether they present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the PHWA and the changes in financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and issue an Independent Auditor's Report stating this opinion. We will apply limited audit procedures to Management's Discussion and Analysis and required supplementary information.\n- We will issue a separate \"management letter\" that includes recommendations for improvements in internal control, accounting procedures and other significant observations that are considered to be non-reportable conditions.\n- We will present and discuss annual financial statements and results of operations to the PHWA Board of Directors upon PHWA's request.\n- We will examine other reports or perform other services as required related to the audit. We will examine other reports or perform other services as required related to the audit.\n- We will prepare the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR).\n\n## **Reporting Requirement:**\n\nFollowing completion of the audit, we will issue the following reports:\n\n- Reports on the fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with GAGAS as listed below:\na) General Purpose Financial Statements for the PHWA.\n\n- A report based on our understanding of the internal control structure and assessment of control risk of the PHWA. In this report, we will also communicate any reportable conditions found during the audit and indicate whether there are any material weaknesses.\n- A Management Letter addressed to the PHWA Board of Directors of the PHWA setting forth recommendations (as applicable) for improvements in PHWA's accounting systems.\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- We will communicate in a letter to the PHWA any reportable conditions found during the audit. A reportable condition shall be defined as a significant deficiency in the design or operation of the internal control structure, which could adversely affect the organization's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements. \"Non-reportable conditions,\" discovered by us will be communicated in the \"Management Letter\".\n- We will make immediate, written notification to the Board of Directors of PHWA of all irregularities and illegal acts or indications of illegal acts of which we become aware.\n\n## **Other Communications:**\n\nWe will make all communications to the Audit Committee required by the audit standards under which the engagement is performed. Those communications include, but are not limited to:\n\n- 1. The auditor's responsibility under GAAP.\n- 2. Significant accounting policies.\n- 3. Management judgment and accounting estimates.\n- 4. Significant audit adjustments.\n- 5. Other information in documents containing audited financial statements.\n- 6. Disagreements with management.\n- 7. Management consultation with other accountants.\n- 8. Major issues discussed with management prior to retention.\n- 9. Difficulties encountered in performing the audit.\n- 10. A written report to the PHWA board of directors of all irregularities and illegal acts or indications of illegal acts of which we become aware.\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Understanding of the Project to be Performed**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the PHWA's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the PHWA Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the PHWA's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the PHWA Officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the PHWA may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the PHWA Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n## **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the PHWA and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to Port Hueneme Water Agency to aid the PHWA's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the PHWA's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n## **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Financial reporting\n- IT and general computer controls\n- Receipts\n- Journal entry process\n\n- Payroll\n- Federal and state programs\nBased on our understanding of the PHWA's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n## **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n## **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the PHWA's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n## **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_26.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_30_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n### **Rules and Regulations**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP will meet all specific requirements imposed by state or local law or rules and regulations. We will review the laws and regulations covering the PHWA's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the PHWA staff and review of any PHWA's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the PHWA of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the PHWA and successor auditors, and allow the PHWA and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance. We will make audit work papers available upon your request.\n\n## **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the PHWA as the work proceeds and once on complete of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities.\n\nBy reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the PHWA's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members. At the completion of the interim work, we will provide a management letter to the Superintendent (or designee) detailing all findings and recommendations noted as of the date of the completion of the interim work. We may substitute a copy of all written findings for the management letter.\n\n![](_page_30_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink* gives us the capability of sending and receiving information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the PHWA's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program; CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we are able to develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of Port Hueneme Water Agency. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the PHWA's employees who are granted access.\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment.

We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the PHWA which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_32_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n## **Audit Work Plan**\n\nProvided a work plan including time estimated and completion dates for each significant segment of the work and staff level to be assigned to the audit.\n\n|  | Audit Work Planning | Staff Level | Hours |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Planning, Supervision/Review | Managing Partner & | 10 |\n| \uf0a1 | Planning | Audit Manager |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Audit Programs |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Supervision and Quality Control Review |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Contingencies/Subsequent Events & Related Parties |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Fraud Risk Assessment |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Oversight Committee Minutes Review |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Correspondence (including Confirmations) |  |  |\n|  | Meeting and Presentations | Managing Partner & | 7 |\n| \uf0a1 | Entrance/Exit Conference | Audit Manager |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Other Meetings |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Meetings with Oversight Committee |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Board Presentation |  |  |\n|  | Internal Control Review | Audit Manager, | 16 |\n| \uf0a1 | Internal Control Interviews and Documentation | Senior Auditors & Staff Auditors |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Risk Assessment |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Journal Entries |  |  |\n|  | Data Processing Review | Managing Partner, | 11 |\n| \uf0a1 | Data Processing Interviews and Documentation | Audit Manager, |  |\n|  |  | Senior Auditors & |  |\n|  | Performance Audit Steps | Staff Auditors |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Compliance |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Test of Contracts and Change Orders |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Expenditure Tests of Allow ability |  |  |\n| \uf0a1 | Site Walk |  |  |\n\n![](_page_32_Picture_8.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_33_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n|  | Substantive Testing Areas | Audit Manager, | 29 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u25a0 | Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities | Senior Auditors & |  |\n| \u25a0 | Accounts Receivable | Staff Auditors |  |\n| \u25a0 | Analytical Review Procedures |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Cash and Cash Equivalents |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Payroll and Other Expenditures |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Fund Balance (if Applicable) |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Interfund Activity (if Applicable) |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Capital Assets |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Long Term Debt |  |  |\n|  | Organization | Audit Manager & | 10 |\n| \u25a0 | Review organizational documents | Senior Auditors |  |\n| \u25a0 | Review board minutes |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Review grants contracts |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Review significant contracts |  |  |\n|  | Exit Conference | Managing Partner & | 5 |\n| \u25a0 | Meet with Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration, the | Audit Manager |  |\n|  | Director of Accounting to discuss results of audit |  |  |\n| \u25a0 | Review draft audit reports |  |  |\n|  | Report Preparation and Review | Managing Partner, | 11 |\n| \u25a0 | Audit Reports Preparation, | Audit Manager, |  |\n|  | Supplemental Schedules and Disclosure | Senior Auditors & |  |\n| \u25a0 | Presentation to the Finance Committee | Staff Auditors |  |\n| \u25a0 | Reports & Communications Delivery |  |  |\n|  | Total Audit Hours |  | \u0a39\u0a47\u0a30\u0a47 |\n\n![](_page_33_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n## **AUDIT SCHEDULE**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP is prepared to meet the deadlines required.\n\n| Milestones | Tentative Timeline |\n| --- | --- |\n| Preliminary work, planning, risk assessment & system evaluation | June - July |\n| Commencement of audit fieldwork | 1st week of October or before |\n| Final audit fieldwork and audit work to be completed | Last week of November or before |\n| Draft audit report and management letter for review | 2nd week of December or before |\n| Final audit report and management letter | December 31 or before |\n\n- *The timeline is reasonable given the totality of work involved and our managers being highly qualified and trained.*\n- *This timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing your accounting records.*\n\n![](_page_34_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_35_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **9.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.\n\n### Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.\n\n![](_page_36_Figure_13.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_37_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a quarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aqgregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.\n\nIn performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:\n\n- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. \u25cf\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures . that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant . accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that . raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\n\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.\n\n### Required Supplementary Information\n\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 4 - 10, and required supplementary information on page 43 through 51 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.\n\n![](_page_37_Picture_13.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_38_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n##48)#'#\n%#*#!4)\"%%$::::! !#%##5##\"#\")##\"$#*##% '$\"# 4 # $)# \"4! *%\"#! #! # *# *'# # '7 $%$$\"\" 6$%#*##\"#\") ##\"$#*#'$\"##%\"#*!##$)#$### )#5##\"#\")##\"$#*#'$\"#7 $# #*\"$#%$'##48)#'#\n%#*####* 5##\"#\")##\"$#*#'$\"#7\n\n![](_page_38_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_39_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE YEAR ENDED\n\nOur discussion and analysis of the Xyz District (the \"District\") provides the reader with an overview of the District's financial position and performance for the period ending June 30, 20XX. The Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) describes the significant changes that occurred in general operations and discusses the activities during the year for capital assets and long-term debt. The discussion concludes with a description of currently known facts, decisions, and conditions that are expected to impact the financial position of the District's operations. We encourage the reader to consider the information presented here in conjunction with the additional information furnished in our letter of transmittal.\n\n## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGovernmental Activities: The District's assets and deferred outflows of resources exceeded liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $- at June 30, 20XX. Total program expenses amounted to $-, while program revenues totaled $-. Additionally, general revenues amounted to $-. Net position consisted of net investment in capital assets totaling $- and an unrestricted decreased by $-. Net position increased by $- as the result of current year operations.\n\nGovernmental Funds: In the governmental funds, the General Fund ended the fiscal year with operating revenues surpassing expenses, yielding a fund balance of $-, with an unassigned fund balance of $-. Meanwhile, the Water Impact Fund and Water Impact Fund experienced operating expenses surpassing revenues, leaving fund balances of $- and $-, respectively, with the entire balances being restricted. Conversely, the Capital Projects #1 Fund ended with operating revenues exceeding expenses, resulting in a fund balance of $-, entirely assigned. Additionally, the Measure O Parcel Tax Fund concluded with operating revenues surpassing expenses, leading to a fund balance of $-. Consequently, the District's governmental fund balances totaled $- at June 30, 20XX, an increase of $- over the prior fiscal year as a result of current year operations.\n\n### Annual Report Overview\n\nThis discussion and analysis serves as an introduction to District's basic financial statements. The basic financial statements include: (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) fund financial statements, and (3) notes to the financial statements. In addition, the financial section of this report contains required supplementary information.\n\nGovernment-wide Financial Statements: The government-wide financial statements provide a broad overview of District's and the manner of presentation is similar to a private-sector business. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 11 - 13.\n\nStatement of Net Position: The statement of net position presents the assets and liabilities of the District as of the end of the fiscal year and is prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which is similar to the accounting basis used by most private-sector organizations. The statement of net position is a point of time financial statement whose purpose is to present to the readers a fiscal snapshot of the District. The statement of net position presents end-of-year data concerning assets (current and noncurrent), deferred outflows of resources, liabilities (current and non-current), deferred inflows of resources, and net position. From the data presented, readers of the statement of net position are able to determine the assets available to continue the operations of the District. Readers are also able to determine the amount owed by the District to vendors and employees. Finally, the statement of net position provides a picture of the net position and the availability of those assets for expenditure. The net between total assets and deferred outflows of resources less total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources (net position) is one indicator of the current financial condition of the District, and the change in net position is an indicator of whether the overall financial condition has improved or worsened during the year. Assets and liabilities are generally measured using current values.\n\n![](_page_39_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_40_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) FOR THE YEAR ENDED\n\n### Annual Report Overview - Cont'd\n\nStatement of Activities: The statement of activities provides information about all the District's revenues and expenditures on the full accrual basis of accounting, with the emphasis on measuring net revenues or expenditures of each specific program. This statement explains in detail the change in Net Position for the vear.\n\nAll of the District's activities in the government-wide financial statements are principally supported by taxes, intergovernmental revenues, Water impact fees, and inspection fees.\n\nFund Financial Statements: A fund is a grouping of related accounts used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities. Like other state and local governments, District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that the District uses to keep track of specific resources of funding and spending for a particular purpose.\n\nThe Governmental funds account for essentially the same functions as those reported in the governmentwide financial statements as \"governmental activities.\" However, governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. This information is useful in evaluating a government's near-term financing requirements. Because the focus of government funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements. it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of near-term financial decisions. Reconciliations are provided to facilitate this comparison for the governmental funds balance sheet and the governmental funds statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances.\n\nThe District reports six governmental funds (General Fund, Capital Projects Fund, Debt Service Fund, Measure O Parcel tax and two Developer Impact Fees). Information for each governmental fund is presented separately in the fund financial statements, because District has elected to classify all governmental funds as major funds. District adopts an annual appropriated budget for each governmental fund. Budgetary comparison statements or schedules are provided for the governmental funds to demonstrate compliance with this budget. The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 14 - 19.\n\nNotes to Financial Statements: The notes provide additional information that is essential to the reader for a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 20 - 42 on this report.\n\nRequired Supplementary Information: In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also presents required supplementary information concerning the District's liabilities related to retirement and other postemployment benefit plans. Required supplementary information, while not a part of the basic financial statements, is considered to be an essential part of the financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. The required supplementary information can be found on pages 43 - 51 on this report.\n\n![](_page_40_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_41_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n #\" % # # # #* # # 58)#'#\" )!$##8)#'#?('###'#\n) \"\"4>\n\n #\" %##$###*##$# *)#'#\" )7 \f) '! # $# ' ) %%\" # *)#'###\"$#7&\"\"4#*%'' #$#0%#12!32 #3233>\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | # |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | 0%#12!3233! |  |  | -/ |  | # |\n|  | 0%#12!3231 |  |  |  |  | '%# |  | #* |\n| %# | E | ? | E | ? | E |  | ? | JL2K |\n|  |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | ?K |\n| $\"!# |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \" |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \"$## |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \" |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \"%\"4% |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| %#\"6\" |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| #%#\"6\" |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \"\"6\" |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \"$## |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \" |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \"#\"4% |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| #)'##$\" |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| > |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| $\"$+#$*' |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| 6) |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | ?K |\n| # |  | ? |  | ? |  |  | ? | JL2K |\n| \"#$# | E | ? | E | ? | E |  | ? | JL2K |\n\nM\n\n![](_page_41_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_42_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n # \"! #* # # $# ) ' ) %%\" # *)#'# ##\"$#7#!#%\"4%=\"6\" ##\"4%6 E?0%#12!327\n\nE?!

During the last fiscal year, the overall assessed valuation increased by (100.0)%. This increase reflects the increase in assessed valuations in the City of City Of District and Town of Client. A considerable portion of the District's potential revenues falls within the City of City Of District Redevelopment Area of which the District is entitled to receive a portion of the pass-through property tax revenues. However, due to the City of City Of District' financial crisis, the District did not receive its pass-through monies in fiscal years 2010-11 through 2022-23, as stated above.\n\n#### Fund Financial Statements\n\nAs noted earlier, the District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with financerelated legal requirements.\n\nGovernmental Funds: Governmental activities are generally accounted for under the General Fund, Capital Projects Fund, Debt Service Fund, Measure O Parcel tax and two Developer Impact Fees funds. Included in these funds are the special districts governed by the Board of Supervisors. The focus of the District's governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and balances as spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the District's short-term financing requirements. In particular, the unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of the government's net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. At June 30, 20XX, the District's governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $-, which is an increase of $compared with the prior year.\n\nMajor Analyses of General Fund & Measure O Parcel Tax Fund\n\nGeneral Fund. The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial resources. The major revenue sources are property taxes and benefit assessments. In this year property taxes revenue increased by $(4,209,637) from the previous year. Overall, the General Fund expenditures decreased by 100.00% from last year.\n\nMeasure O Parcel Tax Special Revenue: The Measure O Parcel Tax Special Revenue fund increased by $(844,178).

Reporting Entity\n\nThe XYZ District is an autonomous district governed by a five (5) member Board of Directors elected at large by the voters of the District. The District covers an area of approximately 32 square miles including the City of Client with a populations of about - and the Town of Client with a population of about - in the unincorporated area of Contra Costa County.\n\nThe financial statements of the District consist only of the funds of the District. The District has no oversight responsibility for any other government entity since no other entities are considered to be controlled by or dependent on the District. Control or dependence is determined on the basis of the respective governing board. The governing board has decision making authority, the power to designate management, and the ability to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters.\n\n### B. Basis of Presentation\n\nThe District's Basic Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board is the acknowledged standard setting body for establishing accounting and financial reporting standards followed by governmental entities in the United States of America.\n\nThese standards require that the financial statements described below be presented.\n\nGovernment-wide Financial Statements: The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities display information about the primary government (the District). These statements include the financial activities of the overall District government. Eliminations have been made to minimize the double counting of internal activities. Governmental activities generally are financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other nonexchange transactions.\n\nThe Statement of Activities presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function of the District's governmental activities. District expenses are those that are specifically associated with a program or function and, therefore, are clearly identifiable to a particular function. Program revenues include (a) charges paid by the recipients of goods or services offered by the programs, (b) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational needs of a particular program, and (c) capital grants and contributions that are restricted to financing the acquisition or construction of capital assets. Revenues that are not classified as program revenues, including all taxes, are presented as general revenues.\n\nFund Financial Statements: The fund financial statements provide information about the District's funds. The emphasis of fund financial statements is on major individual governmental funds, each of which is displayed in a separate column.\n\n![](_page_59_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONT'D\n\n#### C. Major Funds\n\nMajor funds are defined as funds that have either assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenditures/expenses equal to ten percent of their fund-type total and five percent of the grand total. The General Fund is always a major fund. The District may also select other funds it believes should be presented as major funds.\n\nThe District has elected to report all of its funds as major governmental funds in the accompanying financial statements:\n\nGeneral Fund - is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial resources. The major revenue sources are property taxes and benefit assessments. Expenditures are made for public safety and other operating expenditures.\n\nWater Facility Fee Special Revenue Fund - is used to receive fees collected from the City of Client.\n\nWater Facility Fee Special Revenue Fund 2 - is used to receive fees collected from the Town of Client.\n\nMeasure X Parcel Tax Revenue Fund - is used to receive and to account for the proceeds of Measure \"X\" special tax funding.\n\nCapital Projects #1 Fund - is used to account for the District's District capital budget.\n\nDebt Service Fund - is used to account for the proceeds from a line of credit and payments made to vendors related to authorized capital projects.\n\n#### D. Basis of Accounting and Measurement Focus\n\nThe government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the full accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, regardless of when the related cash flows take place.\n\nGovernmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized when measurable and available. The District considers all revenues reported in the governmental funds to be available if the revenues are collected within sixty days after year-end. Expenditures are recorded when the related fund liability is incurred, except for principal and interest on general long-term debt, claims and judgments, and compensated absences, which are recognized as expenditures to the extent they have matured. Governmental capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds.\n\nNon-exchange transactions, in which the District gives or receives value without directly receiving or giving equal value in exchange, include taxes, grants, entitlements, and donations. On the accrual basis, revenue from taxes is recognized in the fiscal year for which the taxes are levied or assessed. Revenue from grants, entitlements, and donations is recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. The District may fund programs with a combination of costreimbursement grants, and general revenues. Thus, both restricted and unrestricted net assets may be available to finance program expenditures. The District's policy is to first apply restricted grant resources to such programs, followed by general revenues if necessary.\n\n![](_page_59_Figure_17.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_60_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONT'D\n\n### E. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting\n\nThe Board of Directors follow the following procedures establishing the budgetary data reflected on the financial statement:\n\n- (1) Proposed budget is received by Chief of the District and Board Members.\n- (2) Public hearings are conducted to obtain taxpayer comment.\n- (3) Formal budgetary integration is employed as a management control device during the year for the General Fund.\n- (4) There is no formal budget of revenue as the revenue amount to be received is the previous year's fund balance, plus property tax revenues to be received, less the expense budget.\n- (5) The budgets for the General Fund and the Capital Projects #1 Fund are adopted on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n- (6) The Board of Directors requires the adoption of a summary budget for the General Fund.\n- (7) Appropriations lapse at the end of each fiscal year.\n\n### F. Property Taxes and Special Assessment Revenue\n\nRevenue is recognized in the fiscal year for which the tax and assessment is levied. The County of Contra Costa levies, bills and collects property taxes and special assessment for the District; the County remits the entire amount levied and handles all delinquencies, retaining interest and penalties. Secured and unsecured property taxes are levied on January 01 of the preceding fiscal year.\n\nSecured property tax is due in two installments, on November 01 and February 01, and becomes a lien on those dates. It becomes delinquent on December 10 and April 10, respectively. Unsecured property tax is due on July 01 and becomes delinquent on August 31.\n\nThe term \"unsecured\" refers to taxes on personal property other than real estate, land and buildings. These taxes are secured by liens on the personal property being taxed.\n\nProperty tax revenue is recognized in the fiscal year for which the tax is levied. The County distributes property tax (termed \"settlements\") under the Teeter Plan, which allows the District to receive all property taxes in the year in which they are levied. The County retains any collections of interest, penalties and delinquencies under this plan. A settlement apportionment for 87% of unsecured property taxes is received in September, with the remainder distributed in May. Secured property taxes are received majorly in December.\n\n### G. Compensated Absences\n\nCompensated absences comprise unpaid vacation leave and compensated time off. The District's liability for compensated absences is recorded in the Statement of Net Position. The liability for compensated absences is determined annually and is primarily liquidated in the General Fund. District employees may accrue up to 72 hours of unpaid overtime and may sell up to 24 hours of unpaid overtime and up to 48 hours of vacation time to the District. The following is a summary of changes in compensated absences for the fiscal year ended June 30, 20XX:\n\n![](_page_60_Figure_20.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_60_Picture_22.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_61_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONT'D\n\n#### H. Capital Assets\n\nAll capital assets are valued at historical cost or estimated historical cost if actual historical cost is not available. Contributed capital assets are valued at their estimated fair market value on the date contributed. Capital assets with a minimum value of $- and a useful life of at least one year can be recorded as capital assets.\n\nCapital assets with limited useful lives are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The purpose of depreciation is to spread the cost of capital assets equitably among all users over the life of these assets. The amount charged to depreciation expense each year represents that year's pro rata share of the cost of capital assets.\n\nDepreciation is provided using the straight line method which means the cost of the asset is divided by its expected useful life in years and the result is charged to expense each year until the asset is fully depreciated. The District has assigned the useful lives listed below to capital assets:\n\n| Description | Years | Description | Years |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grounds Improvement |  | Communication Equipment |  |\n| Buildings |  | Computer Hardware |  |\n| Machinery & Tools |  | Audio Visual Equipment |  |\n| Custodial Equipment |  | Athletic Equipment |  |\n| Furniture & Accessories |  | Water Tank |  |\n| Business Machines |  | Vehicles |  |\n\n## Copiers\n\n### I. Leases\n\nLessee: At the commencement of a lease, the District initially measures the lease liability at the present value of payments expected to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability. adiusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus certain initial direct costs. Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life.\n\nKey estimates and judgments related to leases include how the District determines (1) the discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease term, and (3) lease payments.\n\n- The District uses the interest rate charged by the lessor as the discount rate. When the interest rate charged by the lessor is not provided, the District generally uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.\n- . The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are composed of fixed payments and purchase option price that the District is reasonably certain to exercise.\n\nThe District monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease and will remeasure the lease asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability.\n\n![](_page_61_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_62_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONT'D\n\n### I. Leases - Cont'd\n\nLease assets are reported with other capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with long-term debt on the statement of net position.\n\nLessor: At the commencement of a lease, the District initially measures the lease receivable at the present value of payments expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments received. The deferred inflow of resources is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable, adjusted for lease payments received at or before the lease commencement date. Subsequently, the deferred inflow of resources is recognized as revenue over the life of the lease term.\n\nKey estimates and judgments include how the District determines (1) the discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease receipts to present value, (2) lease term, and (3) lease receipts.\n\n- The District uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.\n- The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease receipts included in the \u25cf measurement of the lease receivable is composed of fixed payments from the lessee.\n\nThe District monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its leases, and will remeasure the lease receivable and deferred inflows of resources if certain changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease receivable.\n\n### J. Lease Liabilities\n\nOn July 1, 20XX, the District adopted GASB 87 - Leases and adopted the changes to conform to the provisions of GASB 87 Implementation Guide. Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, using a discount rate based on the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable. Otherwise, the District uses its incremental borrowing rate at commencement date to determine the present value of future payments.\n\nThe District examined the guidance for the current year and concluded that the adoption of GASB 87 leases, had no impact on the financial statements.\n\n### K. Pensions\n\nFor purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the District's Contra Costa County Employees' Retirement Association (CCCERA) plan and additions to/deductions from the Plan's fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CCCERA. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.\n\n![](_page_63_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONT'D\n\n### L. Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)\n\nFor purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB and OPEB expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the District's plan (OPEB Plan) and additions to/deductions from the OPEB Plan's fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CalPERS. For this purpose, benefit payments are recognized when currently due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.\n\n### M. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources\n\nIn addition to assets, the statement of net position and balance sheets reports a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then. The District has deferred outflows of resources of $- related to Pension and $- related to OPEB.\n\nIn addition to liabilities, the statement of net position and balance sheets reports a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents-an acquisition of net position or fund balance that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as inflow of resources (revenue) until that time. The District has deferred inflows of resources of $- related to Pension and $0 related to OPEB.\n\n### N. Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of basic financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n### O. Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the District has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets may include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market and that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over the counter markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable, such as interest rates and curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads. For financial reporting purposes, if an asset has a specified term, a Level 2 input is required to be observable for substantially the full term of the asset.\n\n![](_page_63_Figure_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_64_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nB)\" 1 ? #6)6\" #$% %\" 6 )\"$ %#* 6 #'# )\"6\" %# %'#! 4 '* #\"% 5 4# 7 %\" +% #6\" )\"6\" #'# # '; $$# 4%\" % # #%'#$#)\"6\"';$$#7\n\n)\"%#\"6\" '%%#*#$%''##\")\")\"% !'%'##66#\"4$ \")\"#$%*## #'%'#7\n\n ? \"\"4#* 8)#'#\" %##* # -8\n/'#)6#'$\"'##%###\"'#>\n\n8\n'#7I<>#%6\f6\"*# ? $)#'#) $#*$6*###*'6<A!327\n\n8 '# 7 I@> %6\" ? ) # %6\" %6\" #$ # )\"6\" '# #*'#? $)#'#)$#*$6*###*0%# <A!327\n\n8\n'#7IM>%6$#?#'# #\"* \n#*'#? $)# '#)$#*$6*###*0%#<A!327\n\n8\n'#7II>\f'#6%3233 ? 9%'#\"\"!!# )\" 6*###*0%#<A!327\n\n #$6\"'$\" 32?7\n\n8 '# \" 6\"4 4\"\" 6 '$\"'# # %% ##\"'#>\n\n8\n'# 7 II> \f'#6% 32 ? 9%'#\" ##\"*%# # \"##$#*))#%'#4#$'#A1) \" 6*###*0%#<A!327\n\n8 '# 7 <22> %##* #* # # ? # '#'# 8 '#7M3? $)#'#)\" 6*###*0%#<A! 327\n\n8\n'#7<2<>'$#\n6#? $)#'#) \" 6*###*'6<A!327\n\n %#\" )\"%#*#4#'#4'$ 4\"\")# 7\n\n![](_page_64_Figure_19.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_65_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 2 - CASH AND INVESTMENTS\n\n### A. Policies\n\nCalifornia law requires banks and savings and loan institutions to pledge government securities with a market value of % of the District's cash on deposit or first trust deed mortgage notes with a value of % of the District's cash on deposit as collateral for these deposits. Under California law, this collateral is held in a separate investment pool by another institution in the District's name and places the District ahead of general creditors of the institution. The District has waived collateral requirements for the portion of deposits covered by federal deposit insurance.\n\n#### B. Classification\n\nThe District's investments are carried at fair value as required by generally accepted accounting principles. The District adjusts the carrying value of its investments to reflect their fair value monthly, and it includes the effects of these adjustments in income for that fiscal year.\n\nCash and investments were as follows at June 30, 20XX:\n\n| Cash deposits with the County |\n| --- |\n| LAIF |\n| Total cash and investments |\n\n#### C. Investment in County Treasury\n\nThe District is considered to be a voluntary participant in an external investment pool. The fair value of the District's investment in the pool is reported in the financial statements in cash and cash equivalents at amounts based upon the District's pro-rata share of the fair value provided by the County Treasurer for the entire portfolio (in relation to amortized cost of that portfolio).\n\nThe balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.\n\n### D. Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF)\n\nAs of June 30, 20XX, the District had $- invested in LAIF. The District is a voluntary participant in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) that is regulated by California Government Code Section 16429 under the oversight of the Treasurer of the State of California. The fair value of the District's investment in this pool is reported in the accompanying financial statements at amounts based upon the District's prorata share of the fair value provided by LAIF for the entire LAIF portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by LAIF, which are recorded on an amortized cost basis. The District's investments with LAIF at June 30, 20XX, include a portion of the pool funds invested in structured notes and asset-backed securities.\n\n![](_page_66_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 2 - CASH AND INVESTMENTS - CONT'D\n\n#### E. Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nGASB Statement No. 72, fair Value Measurement and Application, sets forth the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). However, the investments in an external investment pool are not subject to reporting within the level hierarchy.\n\nThe California Local Agency Investment Fund is valued using the fair value factor provided by the Treasurer of the State of California, which is calculated as the fair value divided by the amortized cost of the investment pool. Fair value is defined as the quoted market value on the last trading day of the period.\n\n## NOTE 3 - CAPITAL ASSETS\n\nCapital asset activity for the year ended June 30, 20XX, was as follows:\n\n|  | Balance | Additions/ |  | Balance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | (deletions) |  |  |\n| Governmental Activities: |  |  |  |  |\n| Capital assets not being depreciated: |  |  |  |  |\n| Land | \u0d15 | \u0a1f\u0a47 | \u0a1f\u0a47 |  |\n| Total capital assets not being depreciated |  |  |  |  |\n| Capital assets being depreciated: |  |  |  |  |\n| Structures and improvements |  |  |  |  |\n| Equipment and vehicles |  |  |  |  |\n| Total capital assets being depreciated |  |  |  |  |\n| Less accumulated depreciation: |  |  |  |  |\n| Structures and improvements |  |  |  |  |\n| Equipment and vehicles |  |  |  |  |\n| Total accumulated depreciation |  |  |  |  |\n| Total capital assets being depreciated, net |  |  |  |  |\n| Total capital assets, net | \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 | \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 | \u0ab2\u0acd\u0a95 |  |\n\nDepreciation expense for the year ended June 30, 20XX, was $-\n\n![](_page_66_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_67_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n### NOTE 4 - NET POSITION\n\nNet Position is on the full accrual basis while Fund Balances are measured on the modified accrual basis.\n\nThe government-wide financial statements utilize a net position presentation. Net position is categorized as net investment in capital assets, restricted, and unrestricted.\n\n- Net investment in capital assets Consists of capital assets including restricted capital assets, net of \u25cf accumulated depreciation and reduced by the outstanding balances of any bonds, mortgages, notes or other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets.\n- Restricted net position Consists of net position with constraints placed on the use either by (1) . external groups such as creditors, grantors, contributors or laws or regulations of other governments; or (2) law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.\n- Unrestricted net position - All other net position that does not meet the definition of \"restricted\" or \"net investment in capital assets\".\n\n### Net Position Flow Assumption\n\nWhen a government funds outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted and unrestricted resources, a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the resources are considered to be applied. When both restricted and unrestricted net position is available, it is considered that restricted resources are used first, followed by the unrestricted resources.\n\n### NOTE 5 - FUND BALANCES\n\nThe District's fund balances are classified in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement Number 54 (GASB 54), Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions, which requires the District to classify its fund balances based on spending constraints imposed on the use of resources. For programs with multiple funding sources, the District prioritizes and expends funds in the following order: Nonspendable, Restricted, Committed, Assigned, and Unassigned. Each category in the following hierarchy is ranked according to the degree of spending constraint:\n\nNonspendable represents balances set aside to indicate items do not represent available, spendable resources even though they are a component of assets. Fund balances required to be maintained intact, such as Permanent Funds, and assets not expected to be converted to cash, such as prepaid, notes receivable, and land held for redevelopment are included. However, if proceeds realized from the sale or collection of nonspendable assets are restricted, committed or assigned, then Nonspendable amounts are required to be presented as a component of the applicable category.\n\nRestricted fund balances have external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, laws, regulations, or enabling legislation which requires the resources to be used only for a specific purpose. Encumbrances and nonspendable amounts subject to restrictions are included along with spendable resources.\n\nCommitted fund balances have constraints imposed by formal action of the Board of Directors which may be altered only by formal action of the Board of Directors. Encumbrances and nonspendable amounts subject to council commitments are included along with spendable resources.\n\n![](_page_67_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_68_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n### NOTE 5 - FUND BALANCES - CONT'D\n\nAssigned fund balances are amounts constrained by the District's intent to be used for a specific purpose, but are neither restricted nor committed. Intent is expressed by the Board of Directors or its designee and may be changed at the discretion of the Board of Directors or its designee. This category includes encumbrances; Nonspendables, when it is the District's intent to use proceeds or collections for a specific purpose, and residual fund balances, if any, of Special Revenue, Capital Projects, and Debt Service Funds which have not been restricted or committed.\n\nUnassigned fund balance represents residual amounts that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned. This includes the residual general fund balance and residual fund deficits, if any, of other governmental funds.\n\n### NOTE 6 - PENSION PLAN\n\nPlan Descriptions - The District participates in the Employees' Retirement Association (ERA), a costsharing multiple employer defined benefit pension plan. ERA is governed by the County Employees' Retirement Law of 1937 (California Government Code Section 31450 et seq.), the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA), and the regulations, procedures, and policies adopted by ERA's Board of Retirement. ERA is a cost-sharing multiple employer public employee retirement association whose main function is to provide service retirement, disability, death, and survivor benefits to the General and Safety members employed by the County of Contra Costa. ERA also provides retirement benefits to the employee members for 16 other participating agencies which are members of ERA.\n\nThe management of ERA is vested with the ERA Board of Retirement. The Board consists of twelve trustees of the twelve members, three are alternates four trustees are appointed by the County Board of Supervisors; four trustees (including the Safety alternate) are elected by ERA's active members; two trustees (including one alternate) are elected by the retired membership. Board members serve threeyear terms, with the exception of the County Treasurer who is elected by the general public and serves during his tenure in office.\n\nBenefits Provided - Benefits are based on years of credited service, equal to one year of full time employment. Members may elect service retirement at age of 50 with 10 years of service credit, age 70 regardless of service, or with thirty years of service, regardless of age.\n\nBenefits are administered by the Board under the provision of the 1937 Act. Annual cost-of living adjustments (COLA) to retirement benefits may be granted by the Board as provided by State statutes. Services retirements are based on age, length of service, and final average salary. Employees may withdraw contributions, plus interest credited, or leave them on deposit for a deferred retirement when they terminate or transfer to a reciprocal retirement system.\n\n![](_page_69_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n $\"#5$)##6##0%#12!32!%'',\"\"4>\n\n|  |  | # |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| C | 0#% 2<!32<1 | 0#% 2<!32<1 |\n| #'%\" | 3KSAA | 37AKSMO |\n| #)#*%\" | <2 5) | A 5) |\n| #$ '# | :#\" \" | :#\" \" |\n| '#* | A2 | A3 |\n| :#\" 6#!K\"*6\"'$## | 2K<22K | 2K<22K |\n| 9%'$\" #6%# | <@71IK | <27QMK |\n| 9%'$\" #6%# | 3I7OIK | 3M7A2K |\n\n|  |  | # |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| C | 0#% <!32<1 | 0#% <!32<1 |\n| #'%\" | 3KSA2 | 37OKSAO |\n| #)#*%\" | A 5) | A 5) |\n| #$ '# | :#\" \" | :#\" \" |\n| '#* | A2 | A2 |\n| :#\" 6#!K\"*6\"'$## | 2K<22K | 2K<22K |\n| 9%'$\" #6%# | 3<7A2K | <O72MK |\n| 9%'$\" #6%# | <O7MQK | <<7IMK |\n\n ?#32Q<@-/\"#%6\"'$\" 5\n'#B49% '$\" #6%#\"\"$%6\"'$\" 6'#####%\"66 % # \"\"6)#0%\" 2<\"\"4#*##*#7&%##*#6%#6 \"# '# ##%\"\" # # %\" 6 0%# 12 6 \"\n7 %\"\" '#''%## ##6##6 '$\" %#* ! 4 # #\" '%# ## # %#%# % \"6\" 7 9%#6%#64#%\"\" '###6%# '$\" 7\n\n& # 0%# 12! 32! #6%# *#, $ $## =$# '\"\"#%# $\"#4\"\"4>\n\n#6%#?'$\" E ?\n\n'%#\n\n![](_page_69_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n1<\n\n![](_page_70_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n 0%# 12! 32! $ # $## \"6\" $$# # $##\"6\" $\"#\"\"4>\n\n|  | $# |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ##B6\" |  |\n| :\"\"#% | E | ? |\n|  |  | ? |\n| \"#$##\"6\" | E | ? |\n\n 5#$##\"6\" \"#'%$$##$## \"6\" 7 #$##\"6\" $\"#'%'61<!32!#\" $##\"6\" $\"#%\"%\"#$##\"6\" 4'#6 #%\" )\"%# '6 1<! 32 \"\" 4 '6 1<! 32 %#* # %$ $%7 5$$##$##\"6\" 46#$+#5 \"#*?' #6%# $## $\"# \") $+ #6%# \"\" $$#*'$\" !%\"\" '#7\n\n 5$$##$##\"6\" $\"#4\"\"4>\n\n|  |  |  |  | $# |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  | \"#&% |\n| $#* | $# |  |  | ##B6\" | ## |\n| '$\" |  | $# |  | $#* | $#* |\n| %#8 MQ | ## |  |  | ) | \" |\n| 0%#12 | B6\" | ##B6\" | )$ \"\" | $ \"\" | ##B6\" |\n| 32<@ | <7<3IK E |  | E | JL2K | AI7QMK |\n| 32<A | <7<3IK |  |  | JL2K | MA7QIK |\n| 32<M | <72<3K |  |  | JL2K | M17AIK |\n| 32<O | <72@IK |  |  | JL2K | MM7AAK |\n| 32<Q | <7@@<K |  |  | JL2K | O@732K |\n| 32<I | 27Q32K |  |  | @II71IK | O@7@MK |\n| 3232 | <72@@K |  |  | 1Q37M3K | Q<721K |\n| 323< | <7@3IK |  |  | 3M17I<K | QM7M2K |\n| 3233 | -<7AA1/K |  |  | <@27@3K | I37QAK |\n| 3231 | 27O@MK E |  | E | A<Q7@<K | OO7@3K |\n\n![](_page_70_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_71_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n& #0%#12!32!*#,$##=$#L-#'/E?7\n0%# 12!32!$%\"4%##\"4%\" $##'\"\"4#*%>\n\n|  |  |  |  | %\"4 |  | #\"4 |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  | % |  | % |  |\n| ## | #6%# | %69%# | '%'# |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  | E | ?

Deferred Compensation Plan\n\nDistrict employees may defer a portion of their compensation under a District sponsored Deferred Compensation Plans created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 457. Under these plans. participants are not taxed on the deferred portion of their compensation until distributed to them: distributions may be made only at termination, retirement, and death or in an emergency as defined by the Plans.\n\nThe laws governing deferred compensation plan assets require plan assets to be held in a Trust for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries. Since the assets held under these plans are not the District's property, are not managed by the District and are not subject to claims by general creditors of the District, they have been excluded from these financial statements.\n\n### B. Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)\n\nAt June 30, 20XX, net OPEB liability and related deferred outflows/inflows of resources are as follows:\n\n| Deferred outflows of resources |\n| --- |\n| Net OPEB liability |\n| Deferred inflows of resources |\n\n#### Plan Description \u25cf\n\nThe District provides 50% of postretirement health care benefits to full time employees who retire directly from the District after attaining the age of 50 with 10 years of service, with an increase of 5% for every year of service exceeding 10 years of service. After 20 years of service the District provides 100% of postretirement health care benefits.\n\nThe District is a participant of the California Employers' Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT), an agent multipleemployer plan administered by CalPERS, consisting of an aggregation of single employer plans. This trust is not considered a component unit of the District and has been excluded from these financial statements. Separately issued financial statements for CERBT may be obtained from CalPERS at Address_\n\n#### \u25cf Eligibility\n\nIn order to qualify for postemployment medical benefits, an employee must retire from the District and maintain enrollment in one of District's eligible health plans. The District pays 100% of the medical premium for the retiree, spouse and dependents. At age 65, the District pays the Senior Advantage (Medicare eligible) or Medicare (Non-Medicare eligible) costs, and for those retirees out of the Kaiser area, the District pays up to what it would have paid capped at the actual premium.\n\n#### Description of Retiree Benefits \u25cf\n\n|  | Safety | Miscellaneous |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Benefit types provided | Medical only | Medical only |\n| Duration of Benefits | Lifetime | Lifetime |\n| Required Service | Retirement | Retirement |\n| Minimum Age | Retirement | Retirement |\n| Dependent Coverage | All eligible | All eligible |\n| District Contribution % | 100% | 100% |\n| District Cap | Kaiser Bay Area Basic Rate | Kaiser Bay Area Basic Rate |\n\n![](_page_74_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_75_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n:'6$)\"%##\"\"4#*>\n\n#)'$\" \n)#*# '# ?\n\n$#*\n)'$\" ?\n\n \"%'6$# ?\n\n### \n\n 5$\" !#*\f##73?2Q!%#\n##%\"\n9%#6%#\n/ 6#6 %'%\"#*4\n %6)$%%#5##%\" 6%* $$) 6 7 ) \f6 2<! 32! $# '$\" 4 '; ##? %#6\"#6%#\n 9%)\"#TK6\" 7 ##%\"9%#6%# \n/ 4 '# $ 0%# 12! 32 %\" )\"%# %#* # * #'\" %\"'7 $+6#'!4;#%#6# =$6##%%4\"\"\" %7\n\n#### \n\n #\f\"6\" 4'%0%#12!32!#\"\f\"6\" % \"%\"#\f\"6\" 4'#6 #%\")\"%#0%#12!327\n\n### \n\n \" \f \"6\" 0%# 12! 32! %\" )\"%# 4 '# %#* \"\"4#* %\"%'$#!$$\"\"\"$#\"%#'%'#!%#\"4$>\n\n| %\"' | # *%\"' |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| %# | K |  |\n| #\"# | K$ %$##$%$7 |  |\n| \"\"# | K$ 7 |  |\n| #)'#%# | K$ !#=$#7 |  |\n| :\" | 32 \" :\" | :\"\"#% |\n|  | '$\" !

A summary of the District's insurance is as follows:\n\n|  | Insurance Company/ Risk |  | Deductible/ Self Insured |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Coverage | Pool | Limit of Liability | Retention |\n| Workers' compensation | FASIS |  |  |\n| Excess worker compensation | FASIS |  |  |\n| All risk property | CSAC |  |  |\n| Earthquake | CSAC |  |  |\n| Boiler & Machinery | CSAC |  |  |\n| Sabotage & Terrorism | CSAC |  |  |\n| General & Automobile liability | CSAC |  |  |\n| Pollution liability | CSAC |  |  |\n| Crime - Forgery or alteration | Fidelity |  |  |\n| Crime - all other | Fidelity |  |  |\n\nCalifornia State Associations of Counties (CSAC) is governed by a Board consisting of representatives from member municipalities. The Board controls the operations of CSAC, including selection of management and approval of operating budgets, independent of any influence by member municipalities beyond their representation on the Board.\n\nThe District did not have any claim settlements that exceed the insurance coverage in the last three years.\n\n### NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nThe District is named as a real party in interest in the Contra Costa County Deputy Sheriffs Association v. Contra Costa County Emplovees' Retirement Association, et al., Contra Costa County Superior Court, Case No. N12-1870. As one of several employers of employees who are members of the Contra Costa County Employees' Retirement Association (CCCERA), the District's interests are aligned with the other public entity defendants who have employee members in the case, such that the District is waiting for a decision as to how, when and where to pay (or not) retiree benefits. The California Attorney General on behalf of the State has intervened in the case and is defending the constitutionality of the Public Employee Pension Reform Act (PEPRA), which amongst other legislation curtailed the ability of employees to spike their pensions through accumulation of sick and leave time, which the District must by law pay anyway. Because of the State's intervention, the District is not taking an active role in the defense of the case because the issues hinge primarily on the constitutionality of the Act, preferring instead to monitor the litigation as the constitutionality of the Act comes into issue before determining what effects, if any, a decision or order will have on its affected CCCERA member employees. The case is currently up on an appeal brought by the petitioners.\n\n![](_page_79_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n### NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - CONT'D\n\nThe District is not joining in, nor will it file its own response to the appeal. The District continues to take a wait and see approach to see how the case is decided at the appellate level, especially since, as a real party in interest, it will be bound similarly to most of the other real parties in interest who have employees that are members of CCCERA. At this point, the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is uncertain, and the amount that is at risk of loss is uncertain.\n\n#### Contingencies and Settlement \u25cf\n\nLos Angeles Department of Water of Power (\"LADWP\") Local 1230 alleged that the District may have failed to properly calculate employees' overtime compensation, potentially under compensating them due to the omission of paramedic premium pay and holiday-in-lieu pay in the overtime rate calculation. This raised concerns regarding Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) compliance.\n\nAfter thorough analysis, the District recognized a potential liability of approximately $185,000 for backpay. liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees associated with the alleged FLSA violations. Accordingly, a provision was recorded in the financial statements for the fiscal year 2022.\n\nSubsequently, on July 30, 20XX, the District, IAFF Local 1230, and affected employees reached a Settlement Agreement and General Release of Claims. The agreement resolves any FLSA or labor contract claim related to the alleged miscalculation of overtime compensation. The District agreed to pay a total settlement of $-, covering back payments to affected employees and attorneys' fees. This settlement amount has been recorded as a current liability in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 20XX.\n\nThis settlement marks the resolution of the dispute, ensuring fair compensation for affected employees and mitigating potential legal risks for the District.\n\n### NOTE 10 - LONG-TERM DEBT\n\nOn July 06, 20XX, the District entered into an installment sale agreement with West America Bank as assignee of Municipal Finance Corporation. On September 03, 20XX, West America Bank provided financing in the initial amount of $- to pay for the cost of the Water Tank. On July 15, 20XX, West America Bank provided supplemental financing of $ -. The annual payments (principal and interest) are $with interest accruing at _%. The repayment begins on September 03, 20XX and matures on September 03, 20XX.\n\nThe District's debt issuances and transactions are summarized below:\n\n|  | Additions/ | Retirements/ | Balance | Due Within |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Adjustments | Adjustments | June 30, 20XX | One Year |\n| Balance July 01, 20XX |  |  |  |  |\n\n![](_page_80_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_80_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n 6)9%'#$#6\"4>\n\n| ##*0%#12! | #$\" |  |  | # |  |  | \" |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 323@ |  | ? |  |  | ? |  | ? |\n| 323A |  | ? |  |  | ? |  | ? |\n| 323M |  | ? |  |  | ? |  | ? |\n| 323O |  | ? |  |  | ? |  | ? |\n| 323Q |  | ? |  |  | ? |  | ? |\n| 323I?3211 |  | ? |  |  | ? |  | ? |\n| 321@?321M |  | ? |  |  | ? |  | ? |\n|  | E | ? | E |  | ? | E | ? |\n\n%#*\" #0%#12!32!'##*6*###* 6)%#6\"#4# %##$ 7\n%\"! $ ##\"'#)6#4#*!\n\n#9%#\" !'$# #*##\"'#)6#\"# %'',6\"47\n\n6)&%##8)#'#?(>\n\n|  | 8)#'#\" |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ) |  |\n| $#?*###*!$)%\" $ | E | ? |\n| '#?# |  | ? |\n| $#?*###*! | E | ? |\n|  | 6) |  |\n|  | &%# |  |\n| &%#\"#?*###*!$)%\" $ | E | ? |\n| '#?# |  | ? |\n\n&%#\"#?*###*!

Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control.\n\nA deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the District's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.\n\nOur consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified.\n\n### Report on Compliance and Other Matters\n\nAs part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether District's financial statements are from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, requlations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordinqly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.\n\n![](_page_92_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_93_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n $%$$\"\" 6$%#*##\"#\"#'$\"# #%\"#*!##$)#$###)###\" #\" # '$\"#7 $ # #*\" $ # % $' # # 4 8)#'#\n%#*####*##\"#\"#'$\"#7\n#*\" !

Our audit programs are continually updated to reflect the revisions of the OMB.\n\n![](_page_13_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_14_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nOur Uniform Guidance risk-based approach focuses on areas of higher risk of noncompliance. Such an approach truly reflects the federal government's intent by concentrating on the following three steps:\n\n![](_page_14_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\nOur firm has audited hundreds of millions of dollars in federal expenditures, making our engagement team uniquely experienced in single audits.

We understand that you require us to conduct and complete a program audit of the PLF for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2023, with an option to extend for three (3) additional years, in accordance with generally accepted auditing principle (GAAP) standards and the standards set forth in the United States General Accounting Office *Government Auditing Standards*. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- Upon completion of the audit, we will issue the following reports:\n\t- A report on the fair presentation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP; and\n\t- An internal control structure based on the auditor's understanding of the control structure and assessment of control risk; and\n\t- Service compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n- We will communicate any reportable conditions found during the audit. Non-reportable conditions discovered by us will be reportable in a separate letter to management. We will make an immediate, written report of all irregularities and illegal acts or indications of illegal acts of which we become aware to the following parties:\n\t- Mervin Wright Jr., Executive Director\n\t- Karen Hernandez, Finance Manager\n\n## **Understanding of the Project to be Performed**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the PLF's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the PLF Manager and Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the PLF's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements.\n\n![](_page_17_Picture_15.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nThe meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the PLF Officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, the assistance the PLF may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the PLF Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n## **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the PLF and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to Pyramid Lake Fisheries to aid the PLF's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n## **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the PLF's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control environment. This phase basically encompasses the planning and risk assessment of your federal programs. The planning phase, if done correctly, will set the tone of the single audit as well as set the stage for an efficient and effective single audit. We will work closely with management to properly identify federal programs and clusters to determine the major programs to be tested.\n\n## **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Receipts\n- Payroll\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state programs\n- IT and general computer controls\n\n![](_page_18_Picture_17.jpeg)\n\nFinancial reporting\n\n![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nBased on our understanding of the PLF's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n## **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n## **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the PLF's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n## **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of a population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n![](_page_19_Picture_17.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Working Paper Retention**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the PLF of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the PLF and successor auditors, and allow the PLF and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n## **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink*, allows us to send and receive information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the PLF's confidential information.\n\nFurthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program - CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we can develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of Pyramid Lake Fisheries. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame.\n\n## **Supervisory Review and Quality Control Procedures**\n\nAll of our documents have levels of review. The various levels are determined by our risk assessment during the planning stages of the audit. Typically, a review will include the following:\n\n- Seniors will review all work performed by staff.\n- Managers will review work performed by seniors as well as review key significant areas that was prepared by staff and reviewed by the senior. Some of these areas include accounts receivable, investments, capital assets, long term debt and pension liabilities, other liabilities, net position classification and single audits.\n- Partners will review areas that are deemed high from a risk perspective as well as the single audit.\n- Technical review will review the report for proper and technical aspects making sure everything is report properly. As a firm, we require all single audits and reporting to be reviewed by another partner with specific government experience.\n\nWe will hold an exit conference with management and provide periodic written or oral reports on the status of the audit to representatives of the PLF. The success of the audit is dependent on the amount of open communication throughout the year and not just during the audit period. We will work closely with management and the accounting personnel throughout the audit process and will hold weekly meetings to go over open items as well as discuss any potential accounting or compliance issues identified during the audit. We believe in no surprises. When we perform the exit conference, we will hold a final discussion on any potential findings and will come to a conclusion during the conference. Our goal is to have no additional findings subsequent to the exit conference.\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_14.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n## **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the PLF as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures.\n\nIt is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency and to spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. If we will become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the PLF's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n## **Audit Work Schedule**\n\n| Milestones | Timeframes for FY 2019 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Planning, risk assessment and system evaluation | Just after contract award |\n| Interim audit fieldwork | Mid of September, 2024 or before |\n| Final audit fieldwork and audit work to be completed | 2nd week of October, 2024 or before |\n| Draft audit reports and management letters for review | 1st week of November, 2024 or before |\n| Final audit reports and management letters | 3rd week of November, 2024 or before |\n\n *This timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing dates of your accounting records.*\n\nWe will meet your deadlines. By engaging in thorough audit planning and communications with management, we begin each engagement with a strong understanding of the various deadlines for each of the financial and single audits and the steps involved along the way to meet these deadlines. An audit project plan will be developed between our team and the PLF and then followed closely, and we will work with the PLF's management team to customize our auditing services and specific timelines to your needs. We believe in clear, up-front and open communication with no surprises.\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n# **STAFF QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE**\n\nThe expertise and experience of Harshwal & Company, LLP partners, and personnel are at the core of the firm's excellence in performing audits of tribes and tribal governments.

Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted. Our plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the RCAC's audit committee and management.\n\nDuring this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress of the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the RCAC's Manager and Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the RCAC's financial systems and processes.\n\nThis will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the RCAC officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the RCAC may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the RCAC officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n### **SPECIFIC AUDIT APPROACH**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide a level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the RCAC and review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to Rural Community Assistance Corporation to aid the RCAC's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n![](_page_17_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_18_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the RCAC's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state programs\n- Cash receipts\n- Financial reporting\n- IT and general computer controls\n\n- Payroll\nBased on our understanding of the RCAC's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n#### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance):**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering RCAC's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing, if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with RCAC staff and review of any RCAC's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n#### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n![](_page_18_Picture_26.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an independent reviewer, audit manager, and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the RCAC's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for review and distribution of reports.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of a population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n### **Working Paper Retention**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the RCAC of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the RCAC and successor auditors, and allow the RCAC and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the RCAC as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures.\n\nIt is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency and to spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. If we will become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the RCAC's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n![](_page_19_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink*, allows us to send and receive information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the RCAC's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through use of the paperless audit program - CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we can develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of the Rural Community Assistance Corporation. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame.\n\n#### **Technologies used to Perform our Audits**\n\nWe are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows: We use the latest technical tools and technology to audit computerized systems. The following are some of the latest tools, which describe our proficiency in audits of computerized environments.\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System.** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called **Suralink**. **Suralink**'s dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination.\n\nIt means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the RCAC's employees who are granted access. You, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The **Suralink** dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment.\n\nWith this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the RCAC which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**CaseWare and CaseView:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper. CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information. Some advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- **Automatic financial reports:** This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- **Automatic footnotes and other information:** This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- **Virtualization:** This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n**Checkpoints Tools:** All Checkpoint Tools come with a complete set of practice aids, including valuable industry-specific practical considerations and guidance. We make sure you have everything you need to complete engagements and tax preparation with ease. Checkpoint Tools provides accounting and audit professionals with valuable industry-specific practical considerations and guidance including SMART Practice Aids\u00ae Audit Suite, PPC's Practice Aids\u2122, PPC's Workpapers\u2122, PPC's Interactive Disclosure Libraries\u2122 and more. These tools work alone or with all paperless engagement products and integrate with AdvanceFlow\u2122 and Workpapers CS, part of the CS Professional Suite from Thomson Reuters.\n\n# **LIST OF WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM**\n\n| Entity | Water Supply | Wastewater System |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cupertino Sanitary District | Not provided | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| Valley of the Moon Water | Water supply (sourcing, | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| District | treatment, distribution) |  |\n| Burbank Sanitary District | Not provided | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| Big Rock Community Service | Water supply (sourcing, | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| District | treatment, distribution) |  |\n| Gasquet Community Services | Water supply (sourcing, | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| District | treatment, distribution) |  |\n| San Miguel Community | Water supply (sourcing, | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| Services District | treatment, distribution) |  |\n| Santa Clara County | Not provided | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| Sanitation District |  |  |\n| Lions Gate Community | Water supply (sourcing, | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| Service District | treatment, distribution) |  |\n| Goshen Community Services | Water supply (sourcing, | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| District | treatment, distribution) |  |\n| Fox Canyon Groundwater | Groundwater management | Not provided |\n| Management Agency | (monitoring and management) |  |\n| Central Basin Municipal | Water supply (imported water | Not provided |\n| Water District | sourcing, treatment, |  |\n|  | distribution) |  |\n| East Palo Alto Sanitary | Not provided | Wastewater collection and treatment |\n| District |  |  |\n\n## **SUBCONTRACTORS**\n\nWe do not use subcontracts.

You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return.

For mortgage interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual reitrement arrangement (IRA), and, generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you must provide your correct TIN. See the instructions for Part II, later.\n\n| Sign | Signature of |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Here | U.S. person | Simmer Harry Chi |\n\n#### Date July 29, 2024\n\n#### General Instructions\n\nSection references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.\n\nFuture developments, For the latest information about developments related to Form W-9 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to www.irs.gov/FormW9.\n\n#### What's New\n\nLine 3a has been modified to clarify how a disregarded entity completes this line. An LLC that is a disregarded entity should check the appropriate box for the tax classification of its owner. Otherwise, it should check the \"LLC\" box and enter its appropriate tax classification.\n\nNew line 3b has been added to this form. A flow-through entity is required to complete this line to indicate that it has direct or indirect foreign partners, owners, or beneficiaries when it provides the Form W-9 to another flow-through entity in which it has an ownership interest. This change is intended to provide a flow-through entity with information regarding the status of its indirect foreign partners, owners, or beneficiaries, so that it can satisfy any applicable reporting requirements. For example, a partnership that has any indirect foreign partners may be required to complete Schedules K-2 and K-3. See the Partnership Instructions for Schedules K-2 and K-3 (Form 1065).\n\n#### Purpose of Form\n\nAn individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information return with the IRS is giving you this form because they\n\nForm W-9 (Rev. 3-2024)\n\n![](_page_33_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nmust obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN), which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or emplover identification number (FIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to you. or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information returns include, but are not limited to, the following\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid).\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds)\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or gross proceeds)\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-NEC (nonemployee compensation).\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain other transactions by brokers).\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-S (proceeds from real estate transactions)\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-K (merchant card and third-party network transactions).\n\n\u00b7 Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan interest), and 1098-T (tuition)\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-C (canceled debt),\n\n\u00b7 Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)\n\nUse Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to provide vour correct TIN.\n\nCaution: If you don't return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding, later.\n\n#### By signing the filled-out form. vou:\n\n 1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued):\n\n2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding; or\n\n3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee; and\n\n4. Certify to your non-foreign status for purposes of withholding under chapter 3 or 4 of the Code (if applicable): and\n\n5. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that you are exempt from the FATCA reporting is correct. See What Is FATCA Reporting, later, for further information.\n\nNote: If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester's form if it is substantially similar to this Form W-9.\n\nDefinition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:\n\n\u00b7 An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;\n\n\u00b7 A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States;\n\n\u00b7 An estate (other than a foreign estate): or\n\n\u00b7 A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).\n\nEstablishing U.S. status for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4 withholding. Payments made to foreign persons, including certain distributions, allocations of income, or transfers of sales proceeds, may be subject to withholding under chapter 3 or chapter 4 of the Code (sections 1441-1474). Under those rules, if a Form W-9 or other certification of non-foreign status has not been received, a withholding agent, transferee, or partnership (pavor) generally applies presumption rules that may require the payor to withhold applicable tax from the recipient, owner, transferor, or partner (payee). See Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.\n\nThe following persons must provide Form W-9 to the payor for purposes of establishing its non-foreign status,\n\n\u00b7 In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the disregarded entity and not the disregarded entity.\n\n\u00b7 In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the grantor trust.\n\n\u00b7 In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust and not the beneficiaries of the trust.\n\nSee Pub. 515 for more information on providing a Form W-9 or a certification of non-foreign status to avoid withholding.\n\nForeign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person (under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) or other applicable section for chapter 3 or 4 purposes), do not use Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Pub. 515). If you are a qualified foreign pension fund under Regulations section 1.897(I)-1(d), or a partnership that is wholly owned by qualified foreign pension funds. that is treated as a non-foreign person for purposes of section 1445 withholding, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use Form W-8EXP (or other certification of non-foreign status).\n\nNonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a saving clause. Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.\n\nIf you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items.\n\n1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien\n\n2. The treaty article addressing the income\n\n3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and its exceptions.\n\n4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax\n\n5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treatv article.\n\nExample. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. Iaw, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if their stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S .- China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first Protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on their scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to support that exemption\n\nIf you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.\n\n#### Backup Withholding\n\nWhat is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 24% of such payments.

Our team has a broad understanding of the standards and requirements necessary to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the Organization. We understand that you require us to conduct an audit of the financial statement of the Organization for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2024, through March 31, 2026, with an option to extend for two (2) additional years. The audit will be conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) issued by American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and *Governmental Auditing Standards* issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, General Accounting Office (GAO); and the audit requirements of Single Audit Act of 1984 (and Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996), OMB Circular A-133, \"Audits of State, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations\" and OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- We will perform a financial statement and Single A-133 audit of the Organization for fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 and subsequent years.\n- We will prepare DCF for submission to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.\n- We will review and present the audit results to the San Francisco Community Health Center's Board of Directors Audit Committee.\n\n### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted. Our plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the Organization's audit committee and management.\n\nDuring this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress of the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the Organization's Manager and Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the Organization's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our auditplanning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the Organization officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the Organization may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the Organization officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n# **SPECIFIC AUDIT APPROACH**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide a level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient yet non-intrusive.\n\n![](_page_11_Picture_12.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nWe believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n#### **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the Organization and review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to San Francisco Community Health Center to aid the Organization's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n#### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the Organization's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements Journal entry process\n- - Federal and state programs\n- Payroll\n- Cash receipts Financial reporting\n- IT and general computer controls\n\nBased on our understanding of the Organization's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n#### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance):**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n#### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering Organization's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing, if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with Organization staff and review of any Organization's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n\n![](_page_12_Picture_25.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_13_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n#### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an independent reviewer, audit manager, and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will undergo thorough review, and any issues identified will be promptly discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the Organization's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for review and distribution of reports.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of a population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using non-statistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n### **Working Paper Retention**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the Organization of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the Organization and successor auditors, and allow the Organization and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n#### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the Organization as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency and to spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the Organization. If we will become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the Organization's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n### **Proposed Timeline for Fieldwork and Final Reporting:**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP is prepared to meet the deadlines required.\n\n| Milestones | Timeframes |\n| --- | --- |\n| Planning, risk assessment and system evaluation | Late July, 2024 |\n| Interim audit fieldwork | 1st week of August, 2024 or before |\n| Field work to be completed | Last week of September, 2024 or before |\n| Draft audit report and management letter for review | 2nd week of October, 2024 or before |\n| Final audit report and management letter | Last week of October, 2024 or before |\n| Tax Return (Form 990, 199 and RRF-1) | November 15, 2024 or before |\n\n![](_page_13_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n# **FEES AND COMPENSATION**\n\nOur fees are generally lower than other competing firms since we keep our overhead low; we follow a scientific audit approach and we make extensive use of emerging technologies that allow us to conduct audits efficiently.

Our team has a broad understanding of the standards and requirements necessary to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the SIHA.\n\nWe understand that you require us to perform a programmatic and financial audit of the financial statements of the SIHA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, with an option to extend for two additional years, in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) as promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA); and other programmatic operations are in conformity with applicable federal statutory and regulatory provisions and other requirements.\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the SIHA's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the SIHA Manager and Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the SIHA's financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements.\n\nThe meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the SIHA officials to go over our plan. During the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the SIHA may need from us and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the SIHA officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from the staff.\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n#### **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the SIHA and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to San Ildefonso Housing Authority to aid the SIHA's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n#### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the SIHA's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Cash receipts\n- Payroll\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state programs\n- Financial reporting\n- IT and general computer controls\n\nBased on our understanding of the SIHA's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n#### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_20.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nOur substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n#### **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the SIHA's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n#### **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance):**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n#### **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of a population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population.\n\n#### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the laws and regulations covering the SIHA's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing, if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the SIHA staff and review of any SIHA's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n#### **Working Paper Retention:**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the SIHA of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the SIHA and successor auditors, and allow the SIHA and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_19.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the SIHA as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency and to spot emerging needs or opportunities.\n\nBy reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the SIHA's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members.\n\n#### **Proposed Segmentation of the Engagement and Timeline:**\n\nOutlined below is an expected timeline and completion of the audit and the expected delivery of the financial statements and management letter; this timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing your accounting records\n\n| Milestones | Timeframes for FY 2023 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Planning, risk assessment and system evaluation | Just after Contract Awarded |\n| Interim audit fieldwork | August, 2024 |\n| Final audit fieldwork and audit work to be completed | Last week of September, 2024 or before |\n| Draft audit report and management letter for review | 2nd week of October, 2024 or before |\n| Final audit report and management letter | Last week of October, 2024 or before |\n\n- *This timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing dates of your accounting records.*\n![](_page_25_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **PROPOSED FEE DETAIL**\n\nOur fees are generally lower than other competing firms since we keep our overhead low; we follow a scientific audit approach and we make extensive use of emerging technologies that allow us to conduct audits efficiently.

Our Managing Partner, Mr. Sanwar Harshwal, has served on GASB committees and in other authoritative positions.\n\n![](_page_17_Picture_60.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Experience with GAAP and GAS Accounting and Reporting**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP maintains a proven track record in the realm of financial reporting, underpinned by a robust expertise in both GAAP and GAS. This extensive experience underscores our commitment to the highest standards of financial integrity and precision. Adhering meticulously to GAAP, we ensure that our financial reporting aligns with universally accepted principles, offering stakeholders a solid foundation for assessing the firm's fiscal performance. Simultaneously, our proficiency in GAS accounting equips us to navigate the intricate landscape of governmental financial reporting, guaranteeing compliance with pertinent standards and regulations. This duality of expertise positions our firm as a reliable and knowledgeable partner, dedicated to furnishing accurate and comprehensive financial information vital for informed decision-making by our clients and stakeholders.\n\n#### **Single Audit Experience**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP works with numerous organizations that receive extensive governmental funding and are subject to auditing under Uniform Grant Guidance, formerly known as OMB Circular A-133 guidelines. We utilize standardized audit programs from the federal government's Compliance Supplement to ensure that our procedures meet the federal standards. Our audit programs are continually updated to reflect the revisions of OMB. Our Uniform Guidance risk-based approach focuses on areas of higher risk of noncompliance. Such approach truly reflects the federal government intent by concentrating on the following three steps:\n\n![](_page_18_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\nOur firm has audited hundreds of millions of dollars in federal expenditures, making our engagement team uniquely experienced in single audits. We are familiar with grantors, such as:\n\n- Department of Health and Human Services\n- Corporation for National and Community Services\n- Department of Agriculture\n- Department of Housing and Urban Development\n- Department of Transportation\n- Environmental Protection Agency\n- Department of Commerce\n- Department of Labor\n- Department of Homeland Security\n- Department of Justice\n- Department of Treasury\n- U.S. Department of the Interior\n- Department of Energy\n\n#### **General Consulting and Compliance Auditing**\n\nOur extensive and proven track record of delivering comprehensive general consulting and compliance auditing services depicts our core strengths and solid position in the industry.

We understand that you require us to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the District for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments and Non Profit Organizations. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n- We will prepare the District's General Purpose Financial Statement (\"GPFS\") and be fully compliant with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (\"GASB\") #34 for the audit year. We will also provide advice on how the District can comply with the requirements of GASB #45 and #54 (upon the District's request). We will render our auditor's report on the basic financial statements.\n- We will issue a separate \"management letter\" that includes recommendations, if any, for improvements in internal control that are considered to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.\n- We will apply limited audit procedures to MD&A and required supplementary information pertaining to each of the District's funding categories.\n\n#### **Understanding of the Project to be Performed:**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted.\n\nOur plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the District's audit committee and management. During this phase, we hope to establish the timetable for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress in the examination. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the District Manager or Finance Director to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the District's financial systems and processes.\n\nThis will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the District Officials to go over our plan.\n\n![](_page_20_Picture_12.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the District may need from us, and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the District Officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from our staff.\n\n## **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the District and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to Selma Healthcare District to aid the District's staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n### **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the District's internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Journal entry process\n- Financial reporting\n\n- Receipts\n- Federal and state programs\n- Payroll\n- IT and general computer controls\nBased on our understanding of the District's risks and control environment, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control environment, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n![](_page_21_Picture_19.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n### **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, and trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n## **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit manager and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the file will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. The financial statements are prepared by the audit manager. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the District's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n## **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centered around the single audit testing of the direct and material elements for the major programs.\n\n## **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude on an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n#### **Rules and Regulations**\n\nHarshwal & Company, LLP will meet all specific requirements imposed by state or local law or rules and regulations. We will review the laws and regulations covering the District's grants and major programs as part of any Single Audit testing if applicable. Based upon our inquiries with the District staff and review of any District's municipal code, etc., we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n![](_page_22_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n#### **Working Paper Retention and Access to Working Papers**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers and reports for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the District of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the District and successor auditors, and allow the District and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance. We will make audit work papers available upon your request.\n\n#### **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the District as the work proceeds and once on complete of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement. The audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency, and spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts, or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the District's Council. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting it to the Board Members. At the completion of the interim work, we will provide a management letter to the Superintendent (or designee) detailing all findings and recommendations noted as of the date of the completion of the interim work. We may substitute a copy of all written findings for the management letter.\n\n## **Technological Advantages**\n\nWe utilize the latest technology, including virtual servers, smart devices, and online libraries, to provide us with the most up-to-date information to better serve our clients. Our online client portal, *Suralink* gives us the capability of sending and receiving information to and from our clients faster and more securely. As portals are encrypted and use password protection to ensure that data can only be viewed by the appropriate client, we are dedicated to protecting the District's confidential information. Furthermore, we streamline our audit process and organize support documents through the use of the paperless audit program; CaseWare Working Papers. By effectively reviewing large volumes of data through these programs, we are able to develop a better understanding and gain a broader view of Selma Healthcare District. These technologies enable us to increase both the scope of our engagement and the reliability of our audit opinion more efficiently, as a larger amount of information can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted in a shorter time frame. We are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology as follows:\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System:** In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink*. Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the District's employees who are granted access.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nYou, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more cost-efficient; it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with an at-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA:** We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the District which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n**CaseWare:** CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView:** CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports.

The president, principals, and staff at Blue Arrow CPAs are pleased to discuss our efficient use of audit technology. We use the latest technical tools and technology to audit computerized systems. The following are some of the latest tools like *CaseWare, CaseView, CaseWare IDEA software, and Suralink*, which describes our proficiency in audits of computerized environments:\n\n**Secure Data File Transfer System**: In order to improve audit efficiency, workflow management software plays an essential role between your organization and our engagement team. We employ a secure data file transfer system called *Suralink.* Suralink's dynamic request list is integrated with our secure file hosting system for seamless document-request coordination. It means all our requests are in one place, updated in real-time, and accessible only by our engagement team working on your audit and the GMC's employees who are granted access. You, as a client, no longer have to manually maintain a spreadsheet amongst several people only to repeat the process in a day or two. This not only makes the operation more costefficient, it enables you and your team to spend your time getting the job done, not reconciling a messy list of outstanding items. The Suralink dashboard, as shown below, allows you to visualize the process of the document-request fulfilment. With this innovative tool, clients can manage workflow through a centralized individual who can assign and delegate requests to other employees; track project activity by assigned individual, due date, and status with a user friendly, easy-to-use, dashboard interface; quickly view and monitor project progress with anat-a-glance report feature; and access how-to videos and training materials through the enhanced learning center.\n\n**IDEA**: We will utilize IDEA data extraction software to assist us in completing our analytical procedures. We will obtain a detail general ledger of all transactions that occurred during the year and download that information into IDEA. We will analyze the data for unusual transactions and create reports for our audit procedures. Additional functionality of this program allows us to receive files in many formats used by the GMC which alleviates the stresses and pressures of converting data into a usable format.\n\n**CaseWare**: CaseWare is a highly flexible engagement software that facilitates real-time adjustments to your trial balance, resulting in simultaneous updates to your financial statements. It enables us to drill down from supporting audit schedules and documents to the underlying detailed accounts. We plan, perform, and review your entire engagement electronically, eliminating the use of paper.\n\n**CaseView**: CaseView is a powerful reporting module that helps review of financial statements, as well as any other customized work paper reports. It utilizes an interface that combines the appropriate features of Word and Excel into a single application that engages word processing features for formatting financial information.\n\nSome advantages of CaseWare and CaseView are as follows:\n\n- Automatic financial reports: This refers to the ability to generate and print financial statements immediately. The numbers in the trial balance are mapped to financial statement tables and foot notes to provide robust and accurate financial statements and reports.\n- Automatic footnotes and other information: This is the ability to format financial statement footnotes with variables (dates, amounts, etc.) that are automatically updated based upon the trial balances and appropriate work paper information.\n- Virtualization: This provides a more consistent approach to financial statement design and a reduced risk of errors in the financial statement reports.\n\n![](_page_23_Picture_12.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_24_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n## **REFERENCES**\n\nWe encourage you to contact these references to inquire about the quality of our services, their overall satisfaction, and the effectiveness of our auditing approach, the expertise of our professionals, and the timeliness and overall value of our services.\n\n| Tribal Gaming |\n| --- |\n\n| Client Name | Contact Name | Contact Information |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kewadin Casinos in Michigan | Don Cooper, | (906)-440-3312 |\n| 2186 Shunk Rd.

Our team has a broad understanding of the standards and requirements necessary to conduct an audit of the GMC. We understand that you require us to perform an annual financial and AUP compliance audit of the GMC for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, with an option to extend for four (4) optional consecutive years, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and issued by the AICPA standards; and the requirements of 25 CFR Parts 542.3 (f) and 543.3 (f), and the National Indian Gaming Commissions (NIGC) Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS) audit checklist. We will adhere to the requirements of the RFP and will be performing the following tasks (including, but not limited to):\n\n#### **We will perform the following audit services:**\n\n- Annual Financial Statement Audit;\n- Agreed-upon procedures to evaluate the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS) compliance;\n- Audit of exclusivity fee payments made to the State of Oklahoma;\n- Title 31/Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) risk assessment; and\n- Infrastructure and security analysis review on the Information Technology (IT) Departments regarding their standards, data security, and governance.\n\n## **Financial Statement Audit:**\n\nThe objective of the financial audit is to express a formal opinion on whether the GMC's basic financial statement (i.e., Balance sheets, Statement of revenues; Expenditures; Changes in fund balance; Statement of cash flow; and asset depreciation, etc.) are fairly presented in all material respects, in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The audit will be conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and issued by the AICPA standards.\n\n#### **Agreed-Upon Procedures:**\n\nAUP will be conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the AICPA, requirements of 25 CFR Parts 542.3 (f) and 543.3 (f), and the National Indian Gaming Commissions (NIGC) Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS) audit checklist. These services will not be providing an opinion but shall note instances of non-compliance.\n\n## **Agreed-upon procedures will consist of:**\n\n- 1. We will compare detailed controls and procedures provided in the NIGC MICS to the detailed controls in the STGC's Tribal Internal Control Standards (TICS) and procedures described in the GMC's System of Internal Controls (SICS) to ascertain whether the criteria set forth in the MICS, or STGC approved variances, are adequately addressed.\n- 2. We will determine whether the NIGC CPA MICS Compliance Checklist, or other comparable testing procedures, were completed by the STGC internal auditing function.\n\n![](_page_25_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n- 3. Concerning checklist described in two (2) above, we will re-perform 3% to 5% of each set of the Checklist procedures for the gaming machine and bingo MICS. A particular portion will be agreed upon in each year's engagement letter.\n- 4. Concerning checklist described in two (2) above, we will re-perform 3% to 5% portions of the procedures for other MICS areas tested by the internal auditor. A particular portion will be agreed upon in each year's engagement letter.\n- 5. Complete Observation Checklist regarding the procedures of Gaming Machine Currency Acceptor Drop and Gaming Machine Currency Count.\n- 6. Concerning checklist described in two (2) above, we will perform 100% of the procedures for the Surveillance MICS.\n- 7. We will provide an external assessment, or quality assurance, of STGC's Internal Audit Department regarding their performance of the MICS audits.\n\n## **Gaming Exclusivity Fees Attestation:**\n\nThis part of the engagement will be conducted in accordance with the attestation standards established by the AICPA. We will express an opinion as to whether the GMC's adjusted gross revenues and exclusivity fee payments are presented, in all material respects, in conformity with the terms of the Compact.\n\n## **Title 31/BSA Act Risk Assessment:**\n\nThis part of the engagement will be to conduct a risk assessment to aid the GMC in meeting the requirements of having a risk-based anti-money laundering program as required by Title 31 of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).\n\n## **Infrastructure and Security IT Review:**\n\nThis part of the engagement will be perform an assessment of the GMC's current IT security profile, vulnerability analysis, and compliance with the regulatory standards of 25 C.F.R. Parts 547 and 543.\n\n## **Reports:**\n\nAll reports issued on the above engagement items will be provided to the STGC Gaming Commission, GMC General Manager, Global Gaming Solutions CFO, and the Shawnee Tribe Business Council as outlined in the engagement letters. Copies of the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) MICS Audit, Title 31 Risk Assessment, and audited financials will be submitted to the NIGC and a copy of the State Exclusivity Fees report shall be submitted to the State of Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services.\n\n![](_page_26_Picture_15.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Understanding of the Project to be Performed**\n\nThe two most critical components of the audit are (1) to have continuity and consistency among the auditors involved and (2) to have the entire audit team, from partners to staff, understand and be aware of the technical requirements for the engagement. Therefore, careful audit planning is emphasized along with written instructions, and a comprehensive workshop is carried out for the staff engaged. We have ascertained that this effort not only serves to state the line of organization and responsibility from the commencement but also serves to discuss the areas of concern and applicable audit techniques to be adopted in the examinations proposed to be conducted. Our plan will involve a comprehensive entrance meeting with the GMC's management.\n\nDuring this phase, we hope to establish the timeline for the examination and identify dates for future meetings to report on our progress. Shortly thereafter, the partners and an audit manager will meet with the Tribal Entities staff and Chief Finance Officer (CFO) to be able to obtain a more detailed outline of the entities' financial systems and processes. This will help us to determine the extent and concentration of our audit effort, obtain knowledge and an understanding of the legal and reporting requirements by obtaining pertinent statues, regulations, charter provisions, bond coverage and other requirements. The meeting will serve as a guideline to prepare and outline our audit-planning memorandum and the audit plan. Upon completion of the audit plan, we will meet with the respective Tribal Entity officials to go over our plan.\n\nDuring the meeting, we hope to share our understanding of the audit approach and fine-tune the dates of commencement, the assistance available to us, and the assistance the GMC may need from us and the introduction of the audit team seniors to the Tribal Entity officials. In the next step, a conference will be initiated by the audit team to be assigned. The conference will serve as a platform to share our audit plan and programs, discuss areas of concern, identify audit teams and dates, and address any and all pertinent questions from the staff.\n\n## **Specific Audit Approach**\n\nOur audit process begins with the assignment of staff to the engagement. Our engagement team has the expertise to provide the level of service desired and deserved by your organization. Our engagements are supervised by the engagement partner and an audit manager. As high-level involvement is vital to a quality audit, the partner and manager's time will account for approximately 30% of the total hours spent on the engagement. Our team's approach is to be efficient, yet non-intrusive. We believe on-going communication throughout the entire audit will ensure that all aspects of the audit are thoroughly addressed. We encourage regular communications throughout the year, not just during fieldwork. As such, we do not anticipate any potential audit problems to arise during our engagement.\n\n## **Audit Planning \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nOur audit planning process includes a risk assessment of the Tribal Entity and a review of the control environment. We begin with a pre-planning meeting to ensure that management's expectations and our expectations are communicated prior to commencing the audit. We will confirm our understanding of the engagement deadlines and ensure these are met in a timely manner. In addition, we will provide a list and samples of schedules specifically tailored to the Golden Mesa Casino entities to aid the staff in preparing schedules and providing audit documentation.\n\n![](_page_27_Picture_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Risk Assessment \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nAs part of our extensive planning phase, the engagement team will discuss with management issues surrounding the applicable industry, the Tribal Entities internal and external environment, significant events, as well as economic, political, and social factors to determine and document areas of risk. Once areas of risk have been identified, the next process will be to review the control Testing.\n\n#### **Control Testing \u2014 Interim Phase**\n\nWe will document and test the following control processes to evaluate their effectiveness in preparing reliable financial statements:\n\n- Disbursements\n- Cash receipts\n- Payroll\n- Journal entry process\n- Federal and state gaming regulatory requirements\n- Financial reporting\n- IT and general computer controls\n\nBased on our understanding of the GMC's risks and control testing, we will design our substantive procedures and communicate our audit approach to management. As part of our review and documentation of the control testing, we may have recommendations for enhancing controls and/or efficiencies. These recommendations will be discussed with management prior to any comments included in a formal management letter.\n\n## **Substantive Procedures \u2014 Year End Phase**\n\nSubstantive audit procedures are designed based on our risk assessment process. Complex and high-risk accounts will be identified early in the audit process and these accounts will be assigned to the manager and/or partner for actual testing. Our substantive audit procedures will include the following:\n\n- Tests of account details Detail transaction testing to source documentation\n- Analytical procedures Ratio analysis, variance analysis, trend analysis\n- Use of data analysis software Review of large volumes of data to detect anomalies\n- Unpredictability tests Varying timing and extent of tests\n- Review of management's estimates \u2014To determine the reasonableness\n- Review of subsequent events and contingencies For proper adjustment and footnote disclosure\n\n## **Preparation of Audit Report and Review \u2014 Year-end Phase and Wrap-up Phase**\n\nAudit work papers are reviewed throughout the audit by an audit director and engagement partner. Before we leave your offices, the report will be substantially reviewed and any issues will be discussed and resolved. All reports are reviewed by the engagement partner and concurring partner. Upon approval, we will issue drafts of all reports based on the GMC's predetermined schedule as indicated in the Request for Proposal. This will allow adequate time for the review and distribution of reports.\n\n![](_page_28_Picture_24.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n## **Audit Sizes and Statistical Sampling Techniques**\n\nAudit sampling provides the auditor with an appropriate basis on which to conclude an audit area by examining evidence from a sample of a population. We utilize both statistical and non-statistical-sampling techniques as described in the AICPA's Audit Sampling Guide, depending on the type of testing being performed. Internal control, substantive, and compliance testing samples are generally selected using nonstatistical techniques. Sample sizes are determined by risk assessment and nature of the population. We may use statistical sampling to assist with forensic testing in areas, which have a higher risk of misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## **Drawing Audit Samples (for tests of compliance)**\n\nAuditor judgment will be used in selecting our audit samples for tests of compliance work. The majority of the testing of compliance will be centred around the agreed-upon procedures engagement to evaluate the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS) compliance.\n\n#### **Laws and Regulations**\n\nWe will review the the Federal, State and Tribal regulations applicable to the GMC as part of our testing. Based upon our inquiries we will determine the relevant laws and regulations that will be subject to additional test work.\n\n#### **Working Paper Retention**\n\nWe will retain audit working papers for a minimum of seven (7) years unless we are notified in writing by the GMC of the need to change the retention period. In addition, we will respond to reasonable inquiries of the GMC and successor auditors, and allow the GMC and successor auditors to review working papers relating to matters of continuing accounting significance.\n\n### **Supervisory Review and Quality Control Procedures**\n\nBlue Arrow CPAs will provide progress reporting on at least a monthly basis to the GMC and will summarize the results of fieldwork and review significant findings on the last day of fieldwork or shortly thereafter. The various levels of supervisory review and quality control procedures include the following:\n\n- Seniors will review all work performed by staff.\n- Manager will review work performed by seniors as well as review key significant areas that was prepared by staff and reviewed by the senior. Some of these areas include accounts receivable, investments, capital assets, long term debt and pension liabilities, other liabilities, net position classification and single audits.\n- Partners will review areas that are deemed high from a risk perspective as well as the AUP engagement to evaluate NIGC MICS compliance.\n- Independent reviewer will review the report for technical aspects ensuring reports are accurate. As a firm, we require all audits and reporting to be reviewed by another partner with specific tribal and governmental experience.\n\n![](_page_30_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n## **Management Letter**\n\nCommunication with management is crucial since it is essential to hear your concerns and comprehend the financial records to have a complete and thorough understanding of business operations. Management confirmation is required on all information contained within the financial statements to ensure that they are true and accurate and that all information has been properly disclosed. We will review all significant audit findings with the Tribal Entities as the work proceeds and once on completion of our audit procedures. It is standard practice for our firm to produce a management letter in conjunction with each engagement.\n\nThe audit process provides an opportunity to assess performance and trends, to identify opportunities to improve internal controls and/or accounting efficiency and to spot emerging needs or opportunities. By reporting these conditions and opening them up for discussion, the management letter can play an important role in maintaining the future financial health of the organization. Should we become aware of any irregularities, illegal acts or indications of illegal acts, we will make an immediate verbal and written report of such findings to the Management. The report will be discussed with the members responsible for the financial statements before submitting.\n\n#### **Tentative Audit Schedule**\n\n| Milestones | Timeframes |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | (For Fiscal Year 2024) |\n| Planning, risk assessment, and system evaluation | September or Before |\n| Audit fieldwork start | 3rd Week of October or Before |\n| Field work to be completed | Last Week of November or Before |\n| Gaming Draft Report and Management Letter for Review | 2nd Week of December or Before |\n| Final Audit Report | Last Week of December or Before |\n\n- **The timeline is reasonable given the totality of work involved and our managers being highly qualified and trained.**\n- **This timeline is dependent on the availability of your personnel and is subject to the anticipated closing dates of your accounting records.**\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n# **FIRM'S BID PRICE**\n\nOur fees are generally lower than other competing firms since we keep our overhead low; we follow a scientific audit approach and we make extensive use of emerging technologies that allow us to conduct audits efficiently.

Our staff are highly trained and specialized in the tribal audit and tribal gaming industry, resulting in fewer audit hours, and minimizing day-to-day disruptions. Our staff are available throughout the year to answer any questions free of charge.\n\n## **Rates for Additional Professional Services**\n\nWe will perform additional work only if set forth in an addendum to the contract between the STGC/GMC and our firm. Our fees for the additional services, if required, will be based on the actual time spent by professional or administrative personnel at quoted hourly rates, specified above. Our standard hourly rates vary according to the degree of responsibility involved, and the experience level of the personnel assigned.\n\n## **Manner of Payment**\n\nProgress billings will be sent on the basis of actual audit work completed during the course of the engagement. Interim billings do not cover a period of less than a calendar month. We view this work as being every bit as important and valuable as the work we perform for other clients and we put our best people on it. Any consulting work you request will be performed at the same rates as our audit work.\n\n![](_page_31_Picture_11.jpeg)\n\nINDIAN PREFERENCE\n\n| P.2/2 |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The Blackfeet Tribe |  |  |  |  |\n| The Blackfeet Indian Nation | P.O.

The Net Promoter Score was developed by Bain consultant and author Frederick Reicheld. More information on Net Promoter Score can be found at www.netpromoter.com.\n\n#### CLEARLYRATED\n\nHeadquartered in Portland, Oregon, ClearlyRated is a team of people who believe it's good business for business service providers to place the client experience at the heart of their growth strategy.\n\nTo that end, we're on a mission to help B2B service firms credibly differentiate themselves based on their service by blending a short, client satisfaction survey with an online profile highlighting star ratings and testimonials earned by the firm.
